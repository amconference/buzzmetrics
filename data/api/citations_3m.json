Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2397894,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":282,"cited_by_feeds_count":99,"cited_by_gplus_count":107,"cited_by_msm_count":161,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":4564,"cited_by_rdts_count":13,"cited_by_tweeters_count":3458,"cited_by_videos_count":4,"cited_by_weibo_count":4,"cited_by_accounts_count":4129,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462810},"journal":{"count":23345,"mean":14.449357607951,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":23346},"similar_age_3m":{"count":75444,"mean":6.7151618572962,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":75443},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":913,"mean":33.037570175439,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":912}},"score":4887.3539999999,"history":{"at":4887.3539999999,"1d":1.25,"2d":1.25,"3d":1.25,"4d":1.75,"5d":3.75,"6d":4,"1w":4,"1m":56.884,"3m":4513.088,"6m":4880.3539999999,"1y":4880.3539999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320040111","added_on":1401749948,"published_on":1401663600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411527754,"readers_count":347,"readers":{"mendeley":339,"connotea":0,"citeulike":8},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2397894"},{"title":"An open letter for the people in Gaza ","doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61044-8","nlmid":"2985213R","tq":["An open letter for the people in Gaza A must, must read if you wish to get an unbiased scientific insight on Gaza.","One of the top three medical journals in the world has published An open letter for the people in Gaza #mustread","We as scientists and doctors cannot keep silent while this crime against humanity continues.

This systematic review aims to (i) determine the prevalence of ADAs against infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis; (ii) ascertain whether ADAs are associated with changes in drug efficacy; and (iii) explore the use of concomitant methotrexate to prevent ADA formation. Through a systematic search using Medline and Embase from 29 January 1950 to 29 March 2013, we identified 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of 7969 patients with psoriasis, 950 tested positive for ADAs. Antibodies against infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and ustekinumab were reported in 5·4-43·6%, 0-18·3%, 6-45% and 3·8-6% of patients, respectively. Anti-infliximab antibodies were associated with lower serum infliximab concentrations in three studies, and decreased treatment response in five studies. ADAs against etanercept were non-neutralizing and not associated with any apparent effects on clinical response. Antiadalimumab antibodies were associated with lower serum adalimumab concentrations in three of five studies, and reduced clinical efficacy in four studies. Two of six studies reported that antiustekinumab antibodies were associated with lower Psoriasis Area and Severity Index responses, and three ustekinumab studies noted that most of these antibodies were neutralizing. Although the use of concomitant methotrexate with biological agents to prevent ADA formation in other immune-mediated diseases is promising, their use in psoriasis is sparse. ADA development remains a challenge with biological therapies and therefore should be considered in patients with psoriasis who experience diminished treatment response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1797672,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":162,"cited_by_gplus_count":8,"cited_by_posts_count":3356,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2316,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":2487,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":42,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462046},"journal":{"count":1424,"mean":3.5038594518622,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":1423},"similar_age_3m":{"count":87927,"mean":7.6731906148353,"rank":5,"pct":99,"higher_than":87922},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":15,"mean":1.2928571428571,"rank":1,"pct":93,"higher_than":14}},"score":2077.7999999999,"history":{"at":2077.7999999999,"1d":3.25,"2d":3.25,"3d":5.25,"4d":6.25,"5d":6.25,"6d":6.25,"1w":7.25,"1m":8.25,"3m":2071.8999999999,"6m":2071.8999999999,"1y":2077.7999999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12654","added_on":1380709117,"subjects":["dermatology"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411484314,"readers_count":9,"readers":{"mendeley":8,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=2078&types=stttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=2078&types=stttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=2078&types=stttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1797672"},{"title":"Conscious Brain-to-Brain Communication in Humans Using Non-Invasive Technologies","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0105225","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Um...scientists just invented TELEPATHY.

In addition, the relationship between being employed as a nursing assistant and confidence level with basic nursing care when entering the nursing program was explored. A Likert-scale survey assessing confidence levels of basic nursing care was sent to 156 nursing students admitted to a nursing program prior to their first nursing course. Confidence level with nursing skills, nursing assistant employment, and length of nursing assistant employment were assessed. Students were most confident in hand washing (M = 5.87, SD = 0.36), gloving and gowning (M =5.46, SD = 0.75), making an unoccupied bed (M = 5.38, SD = 0.88), and oral temperature (M = 5.30, SD = 0.87). Students were least confident in the fitting for cane (M = 1.74, SD = 1.16) and ambulation with crutches on steps (M =1.81, SD = 1.27). Nursing assistant employment increased student confidence with basic nursing care.

In spite of being effective in normalization of blood glucose levels, the currently used PPARγ agonists from the thiazolidinedione type have serious side effects, making the discovery of novel ligands highly relevant. Natural products have proven historically to be a promising pool of structures for drug discovery, and a significant research effort has recently been undertaken to explore the PPARγ-activating potential of a wide range of natural products originating from traditionally used medicinal plants or dietary sources. The majority of identified compounds are selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), transactivating the expression of PPARγ-dependent reporter genes as partial agonists. Those natural PPARγ ligands have different binding modes to the receptor in comparison to the full thiazolidinedione agonists, and on some occasions activate in addition PPARα (genistein, biochanin A, sargaquinoic acid, sargahydroquinoic acid, resveratrol, amorphastilbol) or the PPARγ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR; the neolignans magnolol and honokiol). A number of in vivo studies suggest that some of the natural product activators of PPARγ (honokiol, amorfrutin 1, amorfrutin B, amorphastilbol) improve metabolic parameters in diabetes animal models, partly with reduced side effects in comparison to full thiazolidinedione agonists. The bioactivity pattern as well as the dietary use of several of the identified active compounds and plant extracts warrants future research regarding their therapeutic potential and the possibility to modulate PPARγ activation by dietary interventions or food supplements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2568202,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_gplus_count":193,"cited_by_posts_count":2505,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1593,"cited_by_accounts_count":1787,"context":{"all":{"count":2463022,"mean":4.9262669510349,"rank":80,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462949},"journal":{"count":451,"mean":5.7654,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":450},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70067,"mean":6.7872910969657,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":70060},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":21,"mean":8.2475,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":20}},"score":1526.45,"history":{"at":1526.45,"1d":34,"2d":84.8,"3d":200.05,"4d":200.05,"5d":201.05,"6d":201.9,"1w":209.25,"1m":534.5,"3m":1526.45,"6m":1526.45,"1y":1526.45},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2014.07.018","added_on":1407129287,"published_on":1406934000,"subjects":["biochemistry","pharmacology"],"scopus_subjects":["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411536969,"readers_count":12,"readers":{"mendeley":10,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=1527&types=ttttttrg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=1527&types=ttttttrg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=1527&types=ttttttrg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2568202"},{"title":"Global sodium consumption and death from cardiovascular causes.","doi":"10.1056/nejmoa1304127","pmid":"25119608","nlmid":"0255562","tq":["What do we know about salt and CV disease?

In the area north and west of the Fukushima Nuclear plant, freshwater fish have been highly contaminated. For example, the mean of active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) is 2,657 Bq/kg at Mano River, 20-40 km north-west from the plant. Bioaccumulation is observed in the Agano river basin in Aizu sub-region, 70-150 km west from the plant. The active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of carnivorous Salmondae is around 2 times higher than herbivorous Ayu. The extent of active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of Ayu is observed in the entire eastern Japan. The some level of the contamination is recognized even in Shizuoka prefecture, 400 km south-west from the plant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1419082,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Conservation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental monitoring","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ichthyology","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":75,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":15358,"cited_by_tweeters_count":9605,"cited_by_accounts_count":9684,"context":{"all":{"count":2463203,"mean":4.9262234652314,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":2463234},"journal":{"count":5055,"mean":12.54464780372,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":5054},"similar_age_3m":{"count":81363,"mean":6.702677023672,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":81362},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":451,"mean":13.771035555556,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":450}},"score":7979.3300000013,"history":{"at":7979.3300000013,"1d":14.3,"2d":14.7,"3d":18.1,"4d":29.9,"5d":46.25,"6d":48.05,"1w":47.9,"1m":442.2,"3m":801.70000000001,"6m":1681.1,"1y":4865.23},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep01742","added_on":1367229100,"published_on":1367190000,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1411545373,"readers_count":21,"readers":{"mendeley":21,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=7980&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=7980&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=7980&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1419082"},{"title":"Vitamin D and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease","doi":"10.1212/wnl.0000000000000755","nlmid":"0401060","tq":["#Neurology: #VitaminD defficiency tied to inreased risk of #Alzheimers #dementia. #Pharmacists","Another large study shows connection between dementia and low vitamin D levels.","relatie zijn tussen Vitamine D deficiëntie ouderen en dementie?

Virologic investigation identified Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) as the causative agent. Full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that EBOV from Guinea forms a separate clade in relationship to the known EBOV strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. Epidemiologic investigation linked the laboratory-confirmed cases with the presumed first fatality of the outbreak in December 2013. This study demonstrates the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2289479,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":64,"cited_by_feeds_count":22,"cited_by_msm_count":55,"cited_by_posts_count":494,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":293,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":438,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":255,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461833},"journal":{"count":9634,"mean":27.396428111699,"rank":16,"pct":99,"higher_than":9618},"similar_age_3m":{"count":79363,"mean":6.7702483304352,"rank":13,"pct":99,"higher_than":79350},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":271,"mean":53.416592592593,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":270}},"score":814.674,"history":{"at":814.674,"1d":14.35,"2d":15.8,"3d":16.8,"4d":18.8,"5d":57,"6d":57.15,"1w":57.15,"1m":192.01,"3m":645.704,"6m":814.674,"1y":814.674},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1404505","added_on":1397824329,"published_on":1397602800,"subjects":["medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411505817,"readers_count":83,"readers":{"mendeley":83,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=815&types=1mvbttrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=815&types=1mvbttrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=815&types=1mvbttrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2289479"},{"title":"Plastic debris in the open ocean","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1314705111","nlmid":"7505876","tq":["a global map ... of the magnitude of the plastic pollution in surface waters #OA","The Plastic Age.
