Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others' positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2397894,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":282,"cited_by_feeds_count":99,"cited_by_gplus_count":107,"cited_by_msm_count":161,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":4564,"cited_by_rdts_count":13,"cited_by_tweeters_count":3458,"cited_by_videos_count":4,"cited_by_weibo_count":4,"cited_by_accounts_count":4129,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462810},"journal":{"count":23345,"mean":14.449357607951,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":23346},"similar_age_3m":{"count":75444,"mean":6.7151618572962,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":75443},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":913,"mean":33.037570175439,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":912}},"score":4887.3539999999,"history":{"at":4887.3539999999,"1d":1.25,"2d":1.25,"3d":1.25,"4d":1.75,"5d":3.75,"6d":4,"1w":4,"1m":56.884,"3m":4513.088,"6m":4880.3539999999,"1y":4880.3539999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1320040111","added_on":1401749948,"published_on":1401663600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411527754,"readers_count":347,"readers":{"mendeley":339,"connotea":0,"citeulike":8},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=4888&types=msvbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2397894"},{"title":"An open letter for the people in Gaza ","doi":"10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61044-8","nlmid":"2985213R","tq":["An open letter for the people in Gaza A must, must read if you wish to get an unbiased scientific insight on Gaza.","One of the top three medical journals in the world has published An open letter for the people in Gaza #mustread","We as scientists and doctors cannot keep silent while this crime against humanity continues.

This systematic review aims to (i) determine the prevalence of ADAs against infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and ustekinumab in patients with psoriasis; (ii) ascertain whether ADAs are associated with changes in drug efficacy; and (iii) explore the use of concomitant methotrexate to prevent ADA formation. Through a systematic search using Medline and Embase from 29 January 1950 to 29 March 2013, we identified 25 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of 7969 patients with psoriasis, 950 tested positive for ADAs. Antibodies against infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab and ustekinumab were reported in 5·4-43·6%, 0-18·3%, 6-45% and 3·8-6% of patients, respectively. Anti-infliximab antibodies were associated with lower serum infliximab concentrations in three studies, and decreased treatment response in five studies. ADAs against etanercept were non-neutralizing and not associated with any apparent effects on clinical response. Antiadalimumab antibodies were associated with lower serum adalimumab concentrations in three of five studies, and reduced clinical efficacy in four studies. Two of six studies reported that antiustekinumab antibodies were associated with lower Psoriasis Area and Severity Index responses, and three ustekinumab studies noted that most of these antibodies were neutralizing. Although the use of concomitant methotrexate with biological agents to prevent ADA formation in other immune-mediated diseases is promising, their use in psoriasis is sparse. ADA development remains a challenge with biological therapies and therefore should be considered in patients with psoriasis who experience diminished treatment response.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1797672,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":162,"cited_by_gplus_count":8,"cited_by_posts_count":3356,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2316,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":2487,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":42,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462046},"journal":{"count":1424,"mean":3.5038594518622,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":1423},"similar_age_3m":{"count":87927,"mean":7.6731906148353,"rank":5,"pct":99,"higher_than":87922},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":15,"mean":1.2928571428571,"rank":1,"pct":93,"higher_than":14}},"score":2077.7999999999,"history":{"at":2077.7999999999,"1d":3.25,"2d":3.25,"3d":5.25,"4d":6.25,"5d":6.25,"6d":6.25,"1w":7.25,"1m":8.25,"3m":2071.8999999999,"6m":2071.8999999999,"1y":2077.7999999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjd.12654","added_on":1380709117,"subjects":["dermatology"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411484314,"readers_count":9,"readers":{"mendeley":8,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=2078&types=stttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=2078&types=stttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=2078&types=stttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1797672"},{"title":"Conscious Brain-to-Brain Communication in Humans Using Non-Invasive Technologies","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0105225","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Um...scientists just invented TELEPATHY.

In addition, the relationship between being employed as a nursing assistant and confidence level with basic nursing care when entering the nursing program was explored. A Likert-scale survey assessing confidence levels of basic nursing care was sent to 156 nursing students admitted to a nursing program prior to their first nursing course. Confidence level with nursing skills, nursing assistant employment, and length of nursing assistant employment were assessed. Students were most confident in hand washing (M = 5.87, SD = 0.36), gloving and gowning (M =5.46, SD = 0.75), making an unoccupied bed (M = 5.38, SD = 0.88), and oral temperature (M = 5.30, SD = 0.87). Students were least confident in the fitting for cane (M = 1.74, SD = 1.16) and ambulation with crutches on steps (M =1.81, SD = 1.27). Nursing assistant employment increased student confidence with basic nursing care.

In spite of being effective in normalization of blood glucose levels, the currently used PPARγ agonists from the thiazolidinedione type have serious side effects, making the discovery of novel ligands highly relevant. Natural products have proven historically to be a promising pool of structures for drug discovery, and a significant research effort has recently been undertaken to explore the PPARγ-activating potential of a wide range of natural products originating from traditionally used medicinal plants or dietary sources. The majority of identified compounds are selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARMs), transactivating the expression of PPARγ-dependent reporter genes as partial agonists. Those natural PPARγ ligands have different binding modes to the receptor in comparison to the full thiazolidinedione agonists, and on some occasions activate in addition PPARα (genistein, biochanin A, sargaquinoic acid, sargahydroquinoic acid, resveratrol, amorphastilbol) or the PPARγ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (RXR; the neolignans magnolol and honokiol). A number of in vivo studies suggest that some of the natural product activators of PPARγ (honokiol, amorfrutin 1, amorfrutin B, amorphastilbol) improve metabolic parameters in diabetes animal models, partly with reduced side effects in comparison to full thiazolidinedione agonists. The bioactivity pattern as well as the dietary use of several of the identified active compounds and plant extracts warrants future research regarding their therapeutic potential and the possibility to modulate PPARγ activation by dietary interventions or food supplements.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2568202,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_gplus_count":193,"cited_by_posts_count":2505,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1593,"cited_by_accounts_count":1787,"context":{"all":{"count":2463022,"mean":4.9262669510349,"rank":80,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462949},"journal":{"count":451,"mean":5.7654,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":450},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70067,"mean":6.7872910969657,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":70060},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":21,"mean":8.2475,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":20}},"score":1526.45,"history":{"at":1526.45,"1d":34,"2d":84.8,"3d":200.05,"4d":200.05,"5d":201.05,"6d":201.9,"1w":209.25,"1m":534.5,"3m":1526.45,"6m":1526.45,"1y":1526.45},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bcp.2014.07.018","added_on":1407129287,"published_on":1406934000,"subjects":["biochemistry","pharmacology"],"scopus_subjects":["Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411536969,"readers_count":12,"readers":{"mendeley":10,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=1527&types=ttttttrg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=1527&types=ttttttrg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=1527&types=ttttttrg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2568202"},{"title":"Global sodium consumption and death from cardiovascular causes.","doi":"10.1056/nejmoa1304127","pmid":"25119608","nlmid":"0255562","tq":["What do we know about salt and CV disease?

In the area north and west of the Fukushima Nuclear plant, freshwater fish have been highly contaminated. For example, the mean of active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of Ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis) is 2,657 Bq/kg at Mano River, 20-40 km north-west from the plant. Bioaccumulation is observed in the Agano river basin in Aizu sub-region, 70-150 km west from the plant. The active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of carnivorous Salmondae is around 2 times higher than herbivorous Ayu. The extent of active cesium (quasi-Cs137) contamination of Ayu is observed in the entire eastern Japan. The some level of the contamination is recognized even in Shizuoka prefecture, 400 km south-west from the plant.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1419082,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Conservation","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental monitoring","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Risk factors","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Ichthyology","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":75,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":15360,"cited_by_tweeters_count":9606,"cited_by_accounts_count":9685,"context":{"all":{"count":2463766,"mean":4.9257310571443,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":2463912},"journal":{"count":5056,"mean":12.543916913947,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":5055},"similar_age_3m":{"count":81364,"mean":6.7026407335029,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":81363},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":451,"mean":13.771035555556,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":450}},"score":7979.6800000013,"history":{"at":7979.6800000013,"1d":15.4,"2d":16.4,"3d":18.75,"4d":30.65,"5d":47.6,"6d":49.15,"1w":49,"1m":443.9,"3m":803.05000000001,"6m":1682.45,"1y":4865.73},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep01742","added_on":1367229100,"published_on":1367190000,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1411557276,"readers_count":21,"readers":{"mendeley":21,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=7980&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=7980&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=7980&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1419082"},{"title":"Vitamin D and the risk of dementia and Alzheimer disease","doi":"10.1212/wnl.0000000000000755","nlmid":"0401060","tq":["#Neurology: #VitaminD defficiency tied to inreased risk of #Alzheimers #dementia. #Pharmacists","Another large study shows connection between dementia and low vitamin D levels.","relatie zijn tussen Vitamine D deficiëntie ouderen en dementie?

Virologic investigation identified Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) as the causative agent. Full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that EBOV from Guinea forms a separate clade in relationship to the known EBOV strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. Epidemiologic investigation linked the laboratory-confirmed cases with the presumed first fatality of the outbreak in December 2013. This study demonstrates the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2289479,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":64,"cited_by_feeds_count":22,"cited_by_msm_count":55,"cited_by_posts_count":494,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":293,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":438,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":255,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461833},"journal":{"count":9634,"mean":27.396428111699,"rank":16,"pct":99,"higher_than":9618},"similar_age_3m":{"count":79363,"mean":6.7702483304352,"rank":13,"pct":99,"higher_than":79350},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":271,"mean":53.416592592593,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":270}},"score":814.674,"history":{"at":814.674,"1d":14.35,"2d":15.8,"3d":16.8,"4d":18.8,"5d":57,"6d":57.15,"1w":57.15,"1m":192.01,"3m":645.704,"6m":814.674,"1y":814.674},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa1404505","added_on":1397824329,"published_on":1397602800,"subjects":["medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411505817,"readers_count":83,"readers":{"mendeley":83,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=815&types=1mvbttrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=815&types=1mvbttrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=815&types=1mvbttrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2289479"},{"title":"Plastic debris in the open ocean","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1314705111","nlmid":"7505876","tq":["a global map ... of the magnitude of the plastic pollution in surface waters #OA","The Plastic Age.

We report a system that demonstrates programmable self-assembly of complex two-dimensional shapes with a thousand-robot swarm.

However, scientific opinion is divided on whether there are significant nutritional differences between organic and non-organic foods, and two recent reviews have concluded that there are no differences. In the present study, we carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods. Most importantly, the concentrations of a range of antioxidants such as polyphenolics were found to be substantially higher in organic crops/crop-based foods, with those of phenolic acids, flavanones, stilbenes, flavones, flavonols and anthocyanins being an estimated 19 (95 % CI 5, 33) %, 69 (95 % CI 13, 125) %, 28 (95 % CI 12, 44) %, 26 (95 % CI 3, 48) %, 50 (95 % CI 28, 72) % and 51 (95 % CI 17, 86) % higher, respectively. Many of these compounds have previously been linked to a reduced risk of chronic diseases, including CVD and neurodegenerative diseases and certain cancers, in dietary intervention and epidemiological studies. Additionally, the frequency of occurrence of pesticide residues was found to be four times higher in conventional crops, which also contained significantly higher concentrations of the toxic metal Cd. Significant differences were also detected for some other (e.g. minerals and vitamins) compounds. There is evidence that higher antioxidant concentrations and lower Cd concentrations are linked to specific agronomic practices (e.g. non-use of mineral N and P fertilisers, respectively) prescribed in organic farming systems. In conclusion, organic crops, on average, have higher concentrations of antioxidants, lower concentrations of Cd and a lower incidence of pesticide residues than the non-organic comparators across regions and production seasons.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2471643,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nutrition

This review briefly summarizes the scientific literature on performance and health of animals consuming feed containing GE ingredients and composition of products derived from them. It also discusses the field experience of feeding GE feed sources to commercial livestock populations and summarizes the suppliers of GE and non-GE animal feed in global trade. Numerous experimental studies have consistently revealed that the performance and health of GE-fed animals are comparable with those fed isogenic non-GE crop lines. United States animal agriculture produces over 9 billion food-producing animals annually, and more than 95% of these animals consume feed containing GE ingredients. Data on livestock productivity and health were collated from publicly available sources from 1983, before the introduction of GE crops in 1996, and subsequently through 2011, a period with high levels of predominately GE animal feed. These field data sets representing over 100 billion animals following the introduction of GE crops did not reveal unfavorable or perturbed trends in livestock health and productivity. No study has revealed any differences in the nutritional profile of animal products derived from GE-fed animals. Because DNA and protein are normal components of the diet that are digested, there are no detectable or reliably quantifiable traces of GE components in milk, meat, and eggs following consumption of GE feed. Globally, countries that are cultivating GE corn and soy are the major livestock feed exporters. Asynchronous regulatory approvals (i.e., cultivation approvals of GE varieties in exporting countries occurring before food and feed approvals in importing countries) have resulted in trade disruptions. This is likely to be increasingly problematic in the future as there are a large number of \"second generation\" GE crops with altered output traits for improved livestock feed in the development and regulatory pipeline. Additionally, advanced techniques to affect targeted genome modifications are emerging, and it is not clear whether these will be encompassed by the current GE process-based trigger for regulatory oversight. There is a pressing need for international harmonization of both regulatory frameworks for GE crops and governance of advanced breeding techniques to prevent widespread disruptions in international trade of livestock feedstuffs in the future.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2659007,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":202,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":659,"cited_by_tweeters_count":416,"cited_by_weibo_count":4,"cited_by_accounts_count":628,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":1047,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461500},"journal":{"count":446,"mean":2.4174426966292,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":445},"similar_age_3m":{"count":47563,"mean":6.7321683276565,"rank":56,"pct":99,"higher_than":47507},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":4,"mean":0.5,"rank":1,"pct":75,"higher_than":3}},"score":425.83,"history":{"at":425.83,"1d":15.35,"2d":50,"3d":254.2,"4d":262.55,"5d":265.3,"6d":267.9,"1w":275.25,"1m":425.83,"3m":425.83,"6m":425.83,"1y":425.83},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.2527/jas.2014-8124","added_on":1409928245,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411521728,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=426&types=msbtttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=426&types=msbtttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=426&types=msbtttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2659007"},{"title":"Heme Oxygenase-1 Drives Metaflammation and Insulin Resistance in Mouse and Man ","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2014.04.043","nlmid":"0413066","tq":["Do you know #obesity doesn't always lead to #diabetes?

While fruit bats are considered natural reservoir, involvement of other species in EBOV transmission is unclear. In 2009, Reston-EBOV was the first EBOV detected in swine with indicated transmission to humans. In-contact transmission of Zaire-EBOV (ZEBOV) between pigs was demonstrated experimentally. Here we show ZEBOV transmission from pigs to cynomolgus macaques without direct contact. Interestingly, transmission between macaques in similar housing conditions was never observed. Piglets inoculated oro-nasally with ZEBOV were transferred to the room housing macaques in an open inaccessible cage system. All macaques became infected. Infectious virus was detected in oro-nasal swabs of piglets, and in blood, swabs, and tissues of macaques. This is the first report of experimental interspecies virus transmission, with the macaques also used as a human surrogate. Our finding may influence prevention and control measures during EBOV outbreaks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1070534,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Virology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Pathogens","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Pathology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Experimental organisms","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":185,"cited_by_feeds_count":12,"cited_by_gplus_count":10,"cited_by_linkedin_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":17,"cited_by_posts_count":655,"cited_by_rdts_count":4,"cited_by_tweeters_count":305,"cited_by_videos_count":2,"cited_by_weibo_count":4,"cited_by_accounts_count":541,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.92638199219,"rank":616,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461472},"journal":{"count":5045,"mean":12.563643933386,"rank":10,"pct":99,"higher_than":5035},"similar_age_3m":{"count":72830,"mean":5.0204721745458,"rank":19,"pct":99,"higher_than":72811},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":262,"mean":11.69967816092,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":261}},"score":550.558,"history":{"at":550.558,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0.25,"4d":2.5,"5d":2.5,"6d":2.5,"1w":3.5,"1m":79.28,"3m":420.812,"6m":429.562,"1y":447.73},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep00811","added_on":1353004745,"published_on":1352937600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1411276662,"readers_count":57,"readers":{"mendeley":57,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=551&types=msbtrflg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=551&types=msbtrflg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=551&types=msbtrflg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1070534"},{"title":"Plate tectonics found on Europa","doi":"10.1038/513153a","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["In 2nd place this wk: Plate tectonics found on Europa 2/5","News of plate tectonics on Europa could strengthen push for NASA mission there","There's plate tectonics on #Europa, which may boost the idea of sending a mission there.

We have previously found that GA ameliorates adenine-induced chronic renal failure (CRF) in rats. Different brands of GA are commercially available, but their comparative efficacy against adenine-induced CKD is unknown. Here, we explored the effects of three different brands of GA (Sudanese GA, Supergum and GA from BDH) on some physiological, biochemical, and histological effects of adenine-induced CRF in rats. Adenine (0.75 %, w/w in feed, four weeks) reduced body weight, and increased urine output. It also induced significant increases in blood pressure, and in creatinine, urea, several inflammatory cytokines in plasma, and indices of oxidative stress, and caused histological damage in kidneys. Treatment of rats concomitantly with any of the three GA brands, significantly, and to a broadly similar extent, mitigated all the signs of CRF. The results suggested equivalent efficacy of these brands in antagonizing the CRF in this animal model. However, to enable standardization of different brands between laboratories, the use of the chemically well-characterized GA preparation (such as Supergum) is recommended.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2524306,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":486,"cited_by_tweeters_count":482,"cited_by_accounts_count":482,"context":{"all":{"count":2439017,"mean":4.9110476995661,"rank":1102,"pct":99,"higher_than":2437915},"journal":{"count":60,"mean":8.1106779661017,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":59},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70642,"mean":6.7755239025495,"rank":81,"pct":99,"higher_than":70561},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":7,"mean":2.8966666666667,"rank":1,"pct":85,"higher_than":6}},"score":409.1,"history":{"at":409.1,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":1.1,"3m":409.1,"6m":409.1,"1y":409.1},"url":"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23173676","added_on":1405880268,"published_on":1353801600,"subjects":["physiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"downloads":[],"last_updated":1410203294,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=410&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=410&types=tttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=410&types=tttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2524306"},{"title":"Estimates of benefits and harms of prophylactic use of aspirin in the general population.","doi":"10.1093/annonc/mdu225","nlmid":"9007735","tq":["Aspirin vs Cancer: Aspirin Wins! #bcsm @ASCO #health","Daily low-dose #aspirin for a min of 5 yrs benefits #cancer prevention","Aspirin vs #cancer: #aspirin wins.","Evidence may support aspirin use in reducing overall cancer incidence mortality @Annals_Oncology"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f610002280","issns":["0923-7534","1569-8041"],"journal":"Annals of Oncology","cohorts":{"sci":18,"doc":37,"pub":123,"com":9},"altmetric_id":2572963,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Oncology And Carcinogenesis","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":22,"cited_by_feeds_count":7,"cited_by_gplus_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":27,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":274,"cited_by_tweeters_count":187,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":249,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":1122,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460966},"journal":{"count":1495,"mean":4.607140562249,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":1494},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69477,"mean":6.7963869537682,"rank":81,"pct":99,"higher_than":69396},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":77,"mean":2.6109210526316,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":76}},"score":409.07,"history":{"at":409.07,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":1,"1w":10,"1m":29.25,"3m":409.07,"6m":409.07,"1y":409.07},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/annonc/mdu225","added_on":1407323922,"published_on":1407193200,"subjects":["neoplasms"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411041701,"readers_count":18,"readers":{"mendeley":18,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=410&types=emsbttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=410&types=emsbttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=410&types=emsbttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2572963"},{"title":"Attribution of global glacier mass loss to anthropogenic and natural causes","doi":"10.1126/science.1254702","pmid":"25123485","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["Human influence is now responsible for more glacial mass loss than natural causes #climatechange","ICYM: Humans are now the biggest cause of glacier melting","Man-made global warming the dominant cause of glacier loss: Science paper: ($)","From Science: complex attribution history of glacier mass loss; anthro component increasing over time"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","issns":["1095-9203"],"journal":"Science","cohorts":{"sci":49,"pub":149,"com":8,"doc":2},"abstract":"The ongoing global glacier retreat is affecting human societies by causing sea-level rise, changing seasonal water availability, and increasing geohazards.

However, we still do not know the exact physical and chemical properties of the radioactive materials. This study directly observed spherical Cs-bearing particles emitted during a relatively early stage (March 14-15) of the accident. In contrast to the Cs-bearing radioactive materials that are currently assumed, these particles are larger, contain Fe, Zn, and Cs, and are water insoluble. Our simulation indicates that the spherical Cs-bearing particles mainly fell onto the ground by dry deposition. The finding of the spherical Cs particles will be a key to understand the processes of the accident and to accurately evaluate the health impacts and the residence time in the environment.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1721149,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Environmental sciences","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Environmental monitoring","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Atmospheric chemistry","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Geochemistry","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":25,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":1276,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":846,"cited_by_accounts_count":873,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":529,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461559},"journal":{"count":5045,"mean":12.567248215702,"rank":9,"pct":99,"higher_than":5036},"similar_age_3m":{"count":83631,"mean":7.6090279086453,"rank":55,"pct":99,"higher_than":83576},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":554,"mean":11.490849909584,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":552}},"score":592.35000000001,"history":{"at":592.35000000001,"1d":3.2,"2d":3.2,"3d":4.05,"4d":7.5,"5d":7.5,"6d":7.5,"1w":7.5,"1m":23.05,"3m":371.25,"6m":458.55,"1y":513.85},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep02554","added_on":1377902704,"published_on":1377817200,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1411510686,"readers_count":17,"readers":{"mendeley":17,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=593&types=tttttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=593&types=tttttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=593&types=tttttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1721149"},{"title":"Research integrity: Cell-induced stress","doi":"10.1038/511140a","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["The only thing you need to read about the STAP stem-cell saga: By @cyranoski who was all over this since the start","Speaking truth to power esp. important when the power is your boss.

Skin yellowness contributes to an attractive appearance and is influenced both by dietary carotenoids and by melanin. While both increased carotenoid coloration and increased melanin coloration enhance apparent health in Caucasian faces by increasing skin yellowness, it remains unclear firstly, whether both pigments contribute to attractiveness judgements, secondly, whether one pigment is clearly preferred over the other, and thirdly, whether these effects depend on the sex of the face. Here, in three studies, we examine these questions using controlled facial stimuli transformed to be either high or low in (a) carotenoid coloration, or (b) melanin coloration. We show, firstly, that both increased carotenoid coloration and increased melanin coloration are found attractive compared to lower levels of these pigments. Secondly, we show that carotenoid coloration is consistently preferred over melanin coloration when levels of coloration are matched. In addition, we find an effect of the sex of stimuli with stronger preferences for carotenoids over melanin in female compared to male faces, irrespective of the sex of the observer. These results are interpreted as reflecting preferences for sex-typical skin coloration: men have darker skin than women and high melanisation in male faces may further enhance this masculine trait, thus carotenoid coloration is not less desirable, but melanin coloration is relatively more desirable in males compared to females. Taken together, our findings provide further support for a carotenoid-linked health-signalling system that is highly important in mate choice.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2511018,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":314,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":294,"cited_by_accounts_count":309,"context":{"all":{"count":2461160,"mean":4.9245960760784,"rank":1530,"pct":99,"higher_than":2459699},"journal":{"count":227,"mean":8.7234867256637,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":226},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74322,"mean":6.8441178940003,"rank":110,"pct":99,"higher_than":74212},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":9,"mean":7.63125,"rank":1,"pct":88,"higher_than":8}},"score":352,"history":{"at":352,"1d":0.85,"2d":12.85,"3d":12.85,"4d":12.85,"5d":24.7,"6d":24.95,"1w":25.05,"1m":348.2,"3m":352,"6m":352,"1y":352},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17470218.2014.944194","added_on":1405444264,"published_on":1405206000,"subjects":["psychology","psychophysiology"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Social Sciences","Psychology","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411491228,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=352&types=mttttttr","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=352&types=mttttttr","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=352&types=mttttttr"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2511018"},{"title":"Vaginal microbe yields novel antibiotic","doi":"10.1038/nature.2014.15900","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["This might be the best .@NatureNews of all time: Vaginal microbe yields novel antibiotic","Bacterias vaginales permiten desarrollar un nuevo antibiótico.

The physical behaviour of such 'rubble-pile' asteroids has been traditionally described using only gravitational and frictional forces within a granular material. Cohesive forces in the form of small van der Waals forces between constituent grains have recently been predicted to be important for small rubble piles (ten kilometres across or less), and could potentially explain fast rotation rates in the small-asteroid population. The strongest evidence so far has come from an analysis of the rotational breakup of the main-belt comet P/2013 R3 (ref. 7), although that was indirect and poorly constrained by observations. Here we report that the kilometre-sized asteroid (29075) 1950 DA (ref. 8) is a rubble pile that is rotating faster than is allowed by gravity and friction. We find that cohesive forces are required to prevent surface mass shedding and structural failure, and that the strengths of the forces are comparable to, though somewhat less than, the forces found between the grains of lunar regolith.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2594138,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Asteroids, comets and Kuiper belt","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Structural geology","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":6,"cited_by_gplus_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":35,"cited_by_posts_count":74,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":21,"cited_by_accounts_count":70,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":1769,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460319},"journal":{"count":26629,"mean":41.71801239297,"rank":525,"pct":98,"higher_than":26104},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7796764904691,"rank":105,"pct":99,"higher_than":59072},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":627,"mean":77.161006389776,"rank":26,"pct":95,"higher_than":601}},"score":328.444,"history":{"at":328.444,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":33.33,"3m":328.444,"6m":328.444,"1y":328.444},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13632","added_on":1408361661,"published_on":1407884400,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1410136703,"readers_count":7,"readers":{"mendeley":7,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=329&types=mmmbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=329&types=mmmbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=329&types=mmmbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2594138"},{"title":"Discovery of a Rare Pterosaur Bone Bed in a Cretaceous Desert with Insights on Ontogeny and Behavior of Flying Reptiles","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0100005","pmid":"25118592","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Discovery of a Rare Pterosaur Bone Bed in a Cretaceous Desert: Insights on Flying Reptiles","Bones from ~ 50 flying reptiles from Cretaceous found; new species of flying pterosaur (@PLOSONE)","Pterosaur bonebed shows how their crests changed in shape as they grew up.

The material represents a new pterosaur, Caiuajara dobruskii gen. et sp. nov., that is the southermost occurrence of the edentulous clade Tapejaridae (Tapejarinae, Pterodactyloidea) recovered so far. Caiuajara dobruskii differs from all other members of this clade in several cranial features, including the presence of a ventral sagittal bony expansion projected inside the nasoantorbital fenestra, which is formed by the premaxillae; and features of the lower jaw, like a marked rounded depression in the occlusal concavity of the dentary. Ontogenetic variation of Caiuajara dobruskii is mainly reflected in the size and inclination of the premaxillary crest, changing from small and inclined (∼115°) in juveniles to large and steep (∼90°) in adults.

In this view, motor memory is a memory of motor commands, acquired through trial-and-error and reinforcement. Here, we show that the brain controls how much it is willing to learn from the current error through a principled mechanism that depends on the history of past errors. This suggests that the brain stores a previously unknown form of memory, a memory of errors. A mathematical formulation of this idea provides insights into a host of puzzling experimental data, including savings and meta-learning, demonstrating that when we are better at a motor task, it is partly because the brain recognizes the errors it experienced before.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2593868,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":4,"cited_by_posts_count":370,"cited_by_tweeters_count":357,"cited_by_accounts_count":366,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":1902,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460186},"journal":{"count":19936,"mean":22.470885778781,"rank":164,"pct":99,"higher_than":19773},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.780805630661,"rank":111,"pct":99,"higher_than":59066},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":503,"mean":71.012752988048,"rank":26,"pct":94,"higher_than":477}},"score":315.276,"history":{"at":315.276,"1d":0,"2d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"4d":1.35,"5d":2.6,"6d":9.35,"1w":34.05,"1m":61.3,"3m":315.276,"6m":315.276,"1y":315.276},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1253138","added_on":1408360325,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411381614,"readers_count":16,"readers":{"mendeley":15,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=316&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=316&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=316&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2593868"},{"title":"Sexting and Sexual Behavior Among Middle School Students","doi":"10.1542/peds.2013-2991","nlmid":"0376422","tq":["20% of teens report receiving sexts but only 5% report sending them Those 5% must be pretty busy!","Sexting Sexual Behavior among Middle School Students","Middle school students who text at least 100 times a day more likely to be sexually active","Recent research: 20% of middle school students have received a sext."],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5113cf058f6100032b7","issns":["1098-4275"],"journal":"Pediatrics","cohorts":{"doc":6,"pub":33,"sci":1},"altmetric_id":2475874,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":38,"cited_by_posts_count":94,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":40,"cited_by_accounts_count":85,"context":{"all":{"count":2460727,"mean":4.9245138296604,"rank":1836,"pct":99,"higher_than":2459004},"journal":{"count":5263,"mean":15.126532117066,"rank":17,"pct":99,"higher_than":5246},"similar_age_3m":{"count":73508,"mean":6.752091256615,"rank":118,"pct":99,"higher_than":73390},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":37,"mean":4.23,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":36}},"score":321.79,"history":{"at":321.79,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":314.79,"6m":314.79,"1y":314.79},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2013-2991","added_on":1404137145,"subjects":["pediatrics"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1408760216,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=322&types=mmbttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=322&types=mmbttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=322&types=mmbttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2475874"},{"title":"Primary forest cover loss in Indonesia over 2000-2012","doi":"10.1038/nclimate2277","nlmid":"na","tq":["Deforestation now worse in #Indonesia than in #Brazil Indonesia, that's everybody's forest, not yours!","Taux de déforestation annuelle des forêts primaires en Indonésie d'après","Indonesia loses 6 million ha of natural forest from 2000-2012, mostly already-degraded forests on peat and lowlands","Indonesia surpasses Brazil for highest rate of forest loss -

Disruption of the microbiota during maturation by low-dose antibiotic exposure can alter host metabolism and adiposity. We now show that low-dose penicillin (LDP), delivered from birth, induces metabolic alterations and affects ileal expression of genes involved in immunity. LDP that is limited to early life transiently perturbs the microbiota, which is sufficient to induce sustained effects on body composition, indicating that microbiota interactions in infancy may be critical determinants of long-term host metabolic effects. In addition, LDP enhances the effect of high-fat diet induced obesity. The growth promotion phenotype is transferrable to germ-free hosts by LDP-selected microbiota, showing that the altered microbiota, not antibiotics per se, play a causal role. These studies characterize important variables in early-life microbe-host metabolic interaction and identify several taxa consistently linked with metabolic alterations.

Here, we discuss a novel neurophysiological correlate of the fMRI signal, the slow cortical potential (SCP), which also seems to modulate the power of higher-frequency activity, the more established neurophysiological correlate of the fMRI signal. We further propose a hypothesis for the involvement of the SCP in the emergence of consciousness, and review existing data that lend support to our proposal. This hypothesis, unlike several previous theories of consciousness, is firmly rooted in physiology and as such is entirely amenable to empirical testing.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1937820,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information And Computing Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":418,"cited_by_tweeters_count":414,"cited_by_accounts_count":416,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.92638199219,"rank":1951,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460137},"journal":{"count":692,"mean":10.332590448625,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":691},"similar_age_3m":{"count":94840,"mean":7.395879775198,"rank":198,"pct":99,"higher_than":94642},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":29,"mean":12.253357142857,"rank":1,"pct":96,"higher_than":28}},"score":311.28,"history":{"at":311.28,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":2.55,"3m":311.18,"6m":311.18,"1y":311.28},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2009.04.004","added_on":1385545865,"published_on":1246402800,"scopus_subjects":["Neuroscience","Social Sciences","Psychology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1409849622,"readers_count":336,"readers":{"mendeley":329,"connotea":0,"citeulike":7},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=312&types=bttttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=312&types=bttttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=312&types=bttttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1937820"},{"title":"Quantum imaging with undetected photons","doi":"10.1038/nature13586","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Online comment from Bertolotti on Quantum imaging with undetected photons","Original paper describing #quantum_optics experiment demonstrating #weirdness of #quantum_physics is","Original paper describing new quantum optics experiment demonstrating weirdness of #quantumphysics is","fotografiar al gato de Schrödinger sin verlo Quantum imaging with undetected photons (Nature)"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":["0028-0836","1476-4687"],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"sci":18,"pub":57,"com":2,"doc":1},"altmetric_id":2631988,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Quantum optics","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_feeds_count":6,"cited_by_gplus_count":20,"cited_by_msm_count":23,"cited_by_posts_count":144,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":78,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_weibo_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":134,"context":{"all":{"count":2463022,"mean":4.9262669510349,"rank":1962,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461074},"journal":{"count":26630,"mean":41.72796199632,"rank":579,"pct":97,"higher_than":26051},"similar_age_3m":{"count":53236,"mean":6.7729943833943,"rank":108,"pct":99,"higher_than":53128},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":552,"mean":79.502896551724,"rank":26,"pct":95,"higher_than":526}},"score":310.286,"history":{"at":310.286,"1d":0.25,"2d":0.5,"3d":0.5,"4d":0.5,"5d":0.5,"6d":0.5,"1w":0.5,"1m":310.286,"3m":310.286,"6m":310.286,"1y":310.286},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13586","added_on":1409221684,"published_on":1409094000,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411537510,"readers_count":3,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":3},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=311&types=msvbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=311&types=msvbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=311&types=msvbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2631988"},{"title":"Do ship strikes threaten the recovery of endangered eastern North Pacific blue whales?","doi":"10.1111/mms.12157","nlmid":"na","tq":["Blue whale population recovers from whaling!

Although molding of the body with resin-impregnated linen is believed to be an early Pharaonic forerunner to more complex processes, scientific evidence for the early use of resins in artificial mummification has until now been limited to isolated occurrences during the late Old Kingdom (c. 2200 B.C.), their use becoming more apparent during the Middle Kingdom (c. 2000-1600 BC). We examined linen wrappings from bodies in securely provenanced tombs (pit graves) in the earliest recorded ancient Egyptian cemeteries at Mostagedda in the Badari region (Upper Egypt). Our investigations of these prehistoric funerary wrappings using a combination of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and thermal desorption/pyrolysis (TD/Py)-GC-MS have identified a pine resin, an aromatic plant extract, a plant gum/sugar, a natural petroleum source, and a plant oil/animal fat in directly AMS-dated funerary wrappings. Predating the earliest scientific evidence by more than a millennium, these embalming agents constitute complex, processed recipes of the same natural products, in similar proportions, as those utilized at the zenith of Pharaonic mummification some 3,000 years later. The antibacterial properties of some of these ingredients and the localized soft-tissue preservation that they would have afforded lead us to conclude that these represent the very beginnings of experimentation that would evolve into the famous mummification practice of the Pharaonic period.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2594319,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":5,"cited_by_feeds_count":6,"cited_by_msm_count":25,"cited_by_posts_count":109,"cited_by_tweeters_count":70,"cited_by_accounts_count":106,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":2201,"pct":99,"higher_than":2459887},"journal":{"count":52439,"mean":8.1161688470193,"rank":133,"pct":99,"higher_than":52306},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59178,"mean":6.7858531186103,"rank":127,"pct":99,"higher_than":59051},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":1203,"mean":11.951765391015,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":1196}},"score":293.032,"history":{"at":293.032,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":11.68,"3m":293.032,"6m":293.032,"1y":293.032},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103608","added_on":1408362422,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1410434869,"readers_count":6,"readers":{"mendeley":6,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=294&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=294&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=294&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2594319"},{"title":"Sleep is related to neuron numbers in the ventrolateral preoptic/intermediate nucleus in older adults with and without Alzheimer’s disease","doi":"10.1093/brain/awu222","nlmid":"0372537","tq":["Loss of galanin-immunoreactive neurons associated with fragmented sleep in elderly","FREE ARTICLE.

We examined whether husbands' and wives' marijuana use predicted both husbands' and wives' IPV perpetration over the first 9 years of marriage (Wave 1, n = 634 couples). We also examined moderation by antisocial behavior, the spouse's marijuana use, and whether IPV was reported during the year before marriage. These predictive associations were calculated using a time-lagged multivariate generalized multilevel model, simultaneously estimating predictors of husband and wife IPV. In fully adjusted models, we found that more frequent marijuana use by husbands and wives predicted less frequent IPV perpetration by husbands. Husbands' marijuana use also predicted less frequent IPV perpetration by wives. Moderation analyses demonstrated that couples in which both spouses used marijuana frequently reported the least frequent IPV perpetration. There was a significant positive association between wives' marijuana use and wives' IPV perpetration, but only among wives who had already reported IPV perpetration during the year before marriage. These findings suggest there may be an overall inverse association between marijuana use and IPV perpetration in newly married couples, although use may be associated with greater risk of perpetration among women with a history of IPV perpetration.

Magnetic alignment is a suitable paradigm to scan for the occurrence of magnetosensitivity across animal taxa with the heuristic potential to contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of magnetoreception and identify further functions of magnetosensation apart from navigation. With this in mind we searched for signs of magnetic alignment in dogs. We measured the direction of the body axis in 70 dogs of 37 breeds during defecation (1,893 observations) and urination (5,582 observations) over a two-year period. After complete sampling, we sorted the data according to the geomagnetic conditions prevailing during the respective sampling periods. Relative declination and intensity changes of the MF during the respective dog walks were calculated from daily magnetograms. Directional preferences of dogs under different MF conditions were analyzed and tested by means of circular statistics.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2011007,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":592,"cited_by_feeds_count":26,"cited_by_gplus_count":118,"cited_by_msm_count":46,"cited_by_peer_review_sites_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":3440,"cited_by_rdts_count":13,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2558,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":3356,"context":{"all":{"count":2463766,"mean":4.9257310571443,"rank":23,"pct":99,"higher_than":2463929},"journal":{"count":165,"mean":10.746036585366,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":164},"similar_age_3m":{"count":92854,"mean":7.7266610448775,"rank":6,"pct":99,"higher_than":92848},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":21,"mean":11.7425,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":20}},"score":2894.9979999999,"history":{"at":2894.9979999999,"1d":9.188,"2d":32.768,"3d":55.018,"4d":68.118,"5d":129.946,"6d":243.826,"1w":243.826,"1m":246.876,"3m":286.926,"6m":319.376,"1y":2894.9979999999},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1742-9994-10-80","added_on":1388417463,"published_on":1388102400,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411557890,"readers_count":72,"readers":{"mendeley":67,"connotea":0,"citeulike":5},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=2895&types=emvbtrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=2895&types=emvbtrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=2895&types=emvbtrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2011007"},{"title":"Variation in Orgasm Occurrence by Sexual Orientation in a Sample of U.S. Singles","doi":"10.1111/jsm.12669","nlmid":"101230693","tq":["Lesbians report a significantly higher probability of orgasm (75%) than do straight (62%) or bisexual (58%) women.","Variation in Orgasm Occurrence by Sexual Orientation - U.S. Singles","Orgasmfrekvens beroende på kön och sexuell läggning.

In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1906383,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":15,"cited_by_feeds_count":15,"cited_by_gplus_count":20,"cited_by_msm_count":45,"cited_by_posts_count":1941,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1707,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":1804,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9263135916825,"rank":54,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462034},"journal":{"count":19937,"mean":22.543591392456,"rank":6,"pct":99,"higher_than":19931},"similar_age_3m":{"count":89334,"mean":7.7151011384371,"rank":9,"pct":99,"higher_than":89325},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":644,"mean":70.674930015552,"rank":3,"pct":99,"higher_than":641}},"score":1840.884,"history":{"at":1840.884,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":279.43,"6m":719.14000000001,"1y":1840.884},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1244693","added_on":1384456953,"published_on":1384473600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1408882202,"readers_count":620,"readers":{"mendeley":615,"connotea":0,"citeulike":5},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=1841&types=1mvbttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=1841&types=1mvbttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=1841&types=1mvbttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1906383"},{"title":"Nonhuman genetics.

Study 2 was conducted with Western participants (a non-meditator control group) instructed to use the somatic component of the g-tummo practice (vase breathing) without utilization of meditative visualization. Reliable increases in axillary temperature from normal to slight or moderate fever zone (up to 38.3°C) were observed among meditators only during the Forceful Breath type of g-tummo meditation accompanied by increases in alpha, beta, and gamma power. The magnitude of the temperature increases significantly correlated with the increases in alpha power during Forceful Breath meditation. The findings indicate that there are two factors affecting temperature increase. The first is the somatic component which causes thermogenesis, while the second is the neurocognitive component (meditative visualization) that aids in sustaining temperature increases for longer periods. Without meditative visualization, both meditators and non-meditators were capable of using the Forceful Breath vase breathing only for a limited time, resulting in limited temperature increases in the range of normal body temperature. Overall, the results suggest that specific aspects of the g-tummo technique might help non-meditators learn how to regulate their body temperature, which has implications for improving health and regulating cognitive performance.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1329568,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":35,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":399,"cited_by_msm_count":3,"cited_by_posts_count":607,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":51,"cited_by_accounts_count":491,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":793,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461295},"journal":{"count":52439,"mean":8.1161688470193,"rank":43,"pct":99,"higher_than":52396},"similar_age_3m":{"count":82070,"mean":6.3645650367374,"rank":47,"pct":99,"higher_than":82023},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":4323,"mean":7.1700485886164,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":4322}},"score":489.62,"history":{"at":489.62,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":1,"4d":2,"5d":3,"6d":3,"1w":5,"1m":70,"3m":259,"6m":406,"1y":422.85},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058244","added_on":1364666557,"published_on":1364515200,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411315649,"readers_count":34,"readers":{"mendeley":33,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=490&types=mbtrfggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=490&types=mbtrfggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=490&types=mbtrfggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1329568"},{"title":"Transcriptomic Analysis of Tail Regeneration in the Lizard Anolis carolinensis Reveals Activation of Conserved Vertebrate Developmental and Repair Mechanisms","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0105004","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Lizard tails may use a different regeneration mechanism than axolotls and zebrafish #Anolis","Investigadores descubren la receta genética de la regeneración de la cola de los lagartos","RNAseq analysis of lizard tail regeneration (basically they make unsegmented cartilaginous thing, not proper tail)","Descubren la receta genética de la regeneración de la cola de los lagartos #biociencia"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","issns":["1932-6203"],"journal":"PLoS ONE","cohorts":{"sci":13,"pub":46,"com":3},"altmetric_id":2612767,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":13,"cited_by_feeds_count":9,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":18,"cited_by_posts_count":106,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":62,"cited_by_accounts_count":104,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":2790,"pct":99,"higher_than":2459298},"journal":{"count":52439,"mean":8.1161688470193,"rank":161,"pct":99,"higher_than":52278},"similar_age_3m":{"count":58523,"mean":6.8000493147876,"rank":153,"pct":99,"higher_than":58370},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":1201,"mean":11.97106,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":1194}},"score":258.85,"history":{"at":258.85,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0.5,"4d":0.75,"5d":0.75,"6d":0.75,"1w":1.6,"1m":46.48,"3m":258.85,"6m":258.85,"1y":258.85},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0105004","added_on":1408559658,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411291466,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=259&types=mbtttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=259&types=mbtttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=259&types=mbtttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2612767"},{"title":"Archerfish Actively Control the Hydrodynamics of Their Jets.","doi":"10.1016/j.cub.2014.07.059","nlmid":"9107782","tq":["Archerfish; the best shooters in the west","NEW in CB: Archerfish blow their jets skillfully to adjust range","Es el pez arquero, Toxotes jaculator y así lo presentan los investigadores en","For #archerfish, water is not only the medium of life — it affords skillful tool-use.

Novel approaches of treatment are needed for CRC. The purpose of the present study was to investigate cytotoxic effect of external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong (YXQ-EQ) on human colorectal cancer cells. Methods: The effect of YXQ-EQ on viability, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in colorectal cancer HT-29 cells was investigated. Phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2, activation of NF-ĸB and the expression of proteins involved in regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis were examined by Western blot analysis. Results: YXQ-EQ markedly decreased viability and blocked colony formation of HT-29 cells. YXQ-EQ downregulated cyclin D1 expression and increased accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip1), resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. YXQ-EQ induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells in association with decreased expression of antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-xL, XIAP, survivin and Mcl-1 and elevated expression of proapoptotic protein Bax. YXQ-EQ significantly repressed phosphorylation of Akt and Erk1/2 and NF-ĸB activation in HT-29 cells, suggesting that YXQ-EQ may exert cytotoxic effect through regulating signaling pathways critical for cell proliferation and survival. Furthermore, YXQ-EQ treated PBS and an YXQ-EQ treated plant extract induced apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Conclusion: These findings show that YXQ-EQ has potent cytotoxic effect on HT-29 cells and suggest that YXQ-EQ could be potentially used for colorectal cancer treatment either directly or indirectly via carriers.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1426396,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":533,"cited_by_posts_count":685,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2,"cited_by_videos_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":540,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":650,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461438},"journal":{"count":116,"mean":1.4674782608696,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":115},"similar_age_3m":{"count":81810,"mean":6.8073194147343,"rank":46,"pct":99,"higher_than":81764},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":6,"mean":0.35,"rank":1,"pct":83,"higher_than":5}},"score":536.25,"history":{"at":536.25,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":1,"4d":2,"5d":3,"6d":3,"1w":5,"1m":70,"3m":254,"6m":450,"1y":533.75},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000343354","added_on":1367473904,"published_on":1359072000,"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry","pharmacology"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411315649,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=537&types=vtfggggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=537&types=vtfggggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=537&types=vtfggggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1426396"},{"title":"External Qi of Yan Xin Qigong differentially regulates the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways and is cytotoxic to cancer cells but not to normal cells.","doi":"10.1016/j.biocel.2006.06.002","pmid":"16893670","nlmid":"9508482","tq":["Did you know that #energymedicine treatments like #QiGong can be directly toxic to #cancercells?"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ed3cf058f610002b26","issns":[],"journal":"International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology","cohorts":{"pub":1},"abstract":"Long-term clinical observations and ongoing studies have shown significant antitumor effect of external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong which originated from traditional Chinese medicine. In order to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effect of external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong, we have examined its cytotoxic effect on BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells and its effect on the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. We found that external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong dramatically inhibited basal phosphorylation levels of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases, epidermal growth factor-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity. External Qi of Yan Xin Qigong also inhibited constitutive and inducible activities of nuclear factor-kappa B, a target of the Akt and epidermal growth factor receptor pathways. Furthermore, a single 5min exposure of BxPC3 cells to external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong induced apoptosis, accompanied by a dramatic increase of the sub-G1 cell population, DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of caspases 3, 8 and 9, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Prolonged treatment with external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong caused rapid lysis of BxPC3 cells. In contrast, treatment of fibroblasts with external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong induced transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases and Akt, and caused no cytotoxic effect. These findings suggest that external Qi of Yan Xin Qigong may differentially regulate these survival pathways in cancer versus normal cells and exert cytotoxic effects preferentially on cancer cells, and that it could potentially be a valuable approach for therapy of pancreatic carcinomas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1265036,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biochemistry And Cell Biology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_gplus_count":533,"cited_by_posts_count":681,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1,"cited_by_videos_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":536,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":660,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461428},"journal":{"count":322,"mean":3.5380249221184,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":321},"similar_age_3m":{"count":82148,"mean":6.0440083995763,"rank":42,"pct":99,"higher_than":82106},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":21,"mean":1.5475,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":20}},"score":534.5,"history":{"at":534.5,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":1,"4d":2,"5d":3,"6d":3,"1w":5,"1m":70,"3m":254,"6m":450,"1y":533.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocel.2006.06.002","added_on":1361894480,"published_on":1155078000,"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411315649,"readers_count":16,"readers":{"mendeley":16,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=535&types=vtgggggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=535&types=vtgggggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=535&types=vtgggggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1265036"},{"title":"Social Modulation of Contagious Yawning in Wolves","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0105963","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Who knew?

It is often assumed that larger practices provide better care, although there is little evidence for or against this assumption. What is the relationship between practice size-and other practice characteristics, such as ownership or use of medical home processes-and the quality of care? We conducted a national survey of 1,045 primary care-based practices with nineteen or fewer physicians to determine practice characteristics. We used Medicare data to calculate practices' rate of potentially preventable hospital admissions (ambulatory care-sensitive admissions). Compared to practices with 10-19 physicians, practices with 1-2 physicians had 33 percent fewer preventable admissions, and practices with 3-9 physicians had 27 percent fewer. Physician-owned practices had fewer preventable admissions than hospital-owned practices. In an era when health care reform appears to be driving physicians into larger organizations, it is important to measure the comparative performance of practices of all sizes, to learn more about how small practices provide patient care, and to learn more about the types of organizational structures-such as independent practice associations-that may make it possible for small practices to share resources that are useful for improving the quality of care.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2593807,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Applied Economics","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":7,"cited_by_feeds_count":6,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":6,"cited_by_posts_count":279,"cited_by_tweeters_count":230,"cited_by_accounts_count":250,"context":{"all":{"count":2463203,"mean":4.9262234652314,"rank":2961,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460333},"journal":{"count":1846,"mean":21.912831436314,"rank":12,"pct":99,"higher_than":1834},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59473,"mean":6.7698075396825,"rank":165,"pct":99,"higher_than":59308},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":4,"mean":113.96666666667,"rank":2,"pct":50,"higher_than":2}},"score":250.916,"history":{"at":250.916,"1d":0.5,"2d":8.628,"3d":8.628,"4d":8.628,"5d":8.878,"6d":8.878,"1w":9.878,"1m":54.558,"3m":250.916,"6m":250.916,"1y":250.916},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1377/hlthaff.2014.0434","added_on":1408360087,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["healthservicesresearch","publichealth"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411547124,"readers_count":3,"readers":{"mendeley":3,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=251&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=251&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=251&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2593807"},{"title":"Odor tracking in sharks is reduced under future ocean acidification conditions","doi":"10.1111/gcb.12678","nlmid":"na","tq":["#sharkscience #sharkweek Odor tracking in sharks is reduced under future ocean acidification conditions","On the nose or not?

The present study, for the first time, contrasted behavioral and neural responses of face pareidolia with those of letter pareidolia to explore face-specific behavioral and neural responses during illusory face processing. Participants were shown pure-noise images but were led to believe that 50% of them contained either faces or letters; they reported seeing faces or letters illusorily 34% and 38% of the time, respectively. The right fusiform face area (rFFA) showed a specific response when participants \"saw\" faces as opposed to letters in the pure-noise images. Behavioral responses during face pareidolia produced a classification image (CI) that resembled a face, whereas those during letter pareidolia produced a CI that was letter-like. Further, the extent to which such behavioral CIs resembled faces was directly related to the level of face-specific activations in the rFFA. This finding suggests that the rFFA plays a specific role not only in processing of real faces but also in illusory face perception, perhaps serving to facilitate the interaction between bottom-up information from the primary visual cortex and top-down signals from the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Whole brain analyses revealed a network specialized in face pareidolia, including both the frontal and occipitotemporal regions. Our findings suggest that human face processing has a strong top-down component whereby sensory input with even the slightest suggestion of a face can result in the interpretation of a face.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2091121,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":11,"cited_by_feeds_count":13,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":32,"cited_by_posts_count":232,"cited_by_tweeters_count":168,"cited_by_weibo_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":228,"context":{"all":{"count":2463437,"mean":4.9261121084554,"rank":825,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462642},"journal":{"count":451,"mean":5.9423333333333,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":450},"similar_age_3m":{"count":90313,"mean":7.3127795863231,"rank":80,"pct":99,"higher_than":90233},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":6,"mean":2.22,"rank":1,"pct":83,"higher_than":5}},"score":478.758,"history":{"at":478.758,"1d":0.5,"2d":25.93,"3d":42.63,"4d":48.23,"5d":119.862,"6d":228.142,"1w":228.142,"1m":238.592,"3m":248.442,"6m":445.278,"1y":478.758},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2014.01.013","added_on":1391334944,"subjects":["brain","neurology","behavioralsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Neuroscience","Medicine","Health Sciences","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1411552351,"readers_count":24,"readers":{"mendeley":22,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=479&types=msbtttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=479&types=msbtttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=479&types=msbtttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2091121"},{"title":"Extreme expansion of the olfactory receptor gene repertoire in African elephants and evolutionary dynamics of orthologous gene groups in 13 placental mammals","doi":"10.1101/gr.169532.113","nlmid":"9518021","tq":["have loads of olfactory receptors-wonder where they keep them all?

Many viruses, including Ebola virus, actively antagonize STAT1 signaling to counteract the antiviral effects of IFN. Ebola virus VP24 protein (eVP24) binds KPNA to inhibit PY-STAT1 nuclear transport and render cells refractory to IFNs. We describe the structure of human KPNA5 C terminus in complex with eVP24. In the complex, eVP24 recognizes a unique nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) binding site on KPNA5 that is necessary for efficient PY-STAT1 nuclear transport. eVP24 binds KPNA5 with very high affinity to effectively compete with and inhibit PY-STAT1 nuclear transport. In contrast, eVP24 binding does not affect the transport of classical NLS cargo. Thus, eVP24 counters cell-intrinsic innate immunity by selectively targeting PY-STAT1 nuclear import while leaving the transport of other cargo that may be required for viral replication unaffected.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2595385,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical

Here, we tested for the first time whether verbal cueing during sleep can improve vocabulary learning. We cued prior learned Dutch words either during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) or during active or passive waking. Re-exposure to Dutch words during sleep improved later memory for the German translation of the cued words when compared with uncued words. Recall of uncued words was similar to an additional group receiving no verbal cues during sleep. Furthermore, verbal cueing failed to improve memory during active and passive waking. High-density electroencephalographic recordings revealed that successful verbal cueing during NonREM sleep is associated with a pronounced frontal negativity in event-related potentials, a higher frequency of frontal slow waves as well as a cueing-related increase in right frontal and left parietal oscillatory theta power. Our results indicate that verbal cues presented during NonREM sleep reactivate associated memories, and facilitate later recall of foreign vocabulary without impairing ongoing consolidation processes. Likewise, our oscillatory analysis suggests that both sleep-specific slow waves as well as theta oscillations (typically associated with successful memory encoding during wakefulness) might be involved in strengthening memories by cueing during sleep.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2464671,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Neurosciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":171,"cited_by_tweeters_count":149,"cited_by_accounts_count":169,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3139,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458949},"journal":{"count":1291,"mean":5.7085085271318,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":1290},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74221,"mean":6.8399664780382,"rank":193,"pct":99,"higher_than":74028},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":20,"mean":5.7042105263158,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":19}},"score":242.56,"history":{"at":242.56,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"6d":0.25,"1w":0.25,"1m":1.1,"3m":241.71,"6m":242.56,"1y":242.56},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhu139","added_on":1403814946,"subjects":["brain"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411257536,"readers_count":20,"readers":{"mendeley":19,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=243&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=243&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=243&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2464671"},{"title":"NIH to probe racial disparity in grant awards.","doi":"10.1038/512243a","tq":["Is the racial gap in grant awards from a US funding agency due to bias?","Black researchrs win half as many","Black scientists are much less likely to be funded (even after controlling for publications)","An ambitious NIH study will explore whether grant reviewers are biased against minority applicants"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa50a3cf058f610003160","issns":[],"journal":"Nature","cohorts":{"pub":178,"sci":83,"com":24,"doc":12},"altmetric_id":2607729,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":10,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":331,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":297,"cited_by_accounts_count":314,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3162,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458926},"journal":{"count":26629,"mean":41.71801239297,"rank":895,"pct":96,"higher_than":25734},"similar_age_3m":{"count":58747,"mean":6.7897149763388,"rank":174,"pct":99,"higher_than":58573},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":628,"mean":77.561776714513,"rank":52,"pct":91,"higher_than":576}},"score":241.5,"history":{"at":241.5,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":10,"1m":49.9,"3m":241.5,"6m":241.5,"1y":241.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/512243a","added_on":1408457905,"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1410990607,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=242&types=mbtttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=242&types=mbtttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=242&types=mbtttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2607729"},{"title":"Neuroscience: Where is the brain in the Human Brain Project?","doi":"10.1038/513027a","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Europe's €1-billion Human Brain Project needs to clarify its goals and establish transparent governance","Where is the brain in the Human Brain Project?

Researchers have proposed that such guilt could have prosocial consequences. However, this proposition has not been supported with empirical evidence. The current study examined this issue in a 2×2 (video game play vs. real world recollection×guilt vs. control) experiment. Participants were first randomly assigned to either play a video game or complete a memory recall task. Next, participants were randomly assigned to either a guilt-inducing condition (game play as a terrorist/recall of acts that induce guilt) or a control condition (game play as a UN soldier/recall of acts that do not induce guilt). Results of the study indicate several important findings. First, the current results replicate previous research indicating that immoral virtual behaviors are capable of eliciting guilt. Second, and more importantly, the guilt elicited by game play led to intuition-specific increases in the salience of violated moral foundations. These findings indicate that committing \"immoral\" virtual behaviors in a video game can lead to increased moral sensitivity of the player. The potential prosocial benefits of these findings are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2454567,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Information Systems","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":12,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_gplus_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":21,"cited_by_posts_count":128,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":79,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":123,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":3101,"pct":99,"higher_than":2459513},"journal":{"count":412,"mean":13.951518248175,"rank":3,"pct":99,"higher_than":409},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74970,"mean":6.8415182542117,"rank":187,"pct":99,"higher_than":74783},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":18,"mean":9.0362352941176,"rank":1,"pct":94,"higher_than":17}},"score":244.864,"history":{"at":244.864,"1d":0.25,"2d":0.25,"3d":1.35,"4d":1.75,"5d":2.6,"6d":2.6,"1w":2.6,"1m":2.6,"3m":235.314,"6m":244.864,"1y":244.864},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cyber.2013.0658","added_on":1403338615,"published_on":1403218800,"subjects":["psychology","behavioralsciences"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1411522631,"readers_count":7,"readers":{"mendeley":6,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=245&types=mvbttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=245&types=mvbttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=245&types=mvbttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2454567"},{"title":"Noble gases identify the mechanisms of fugitive gas contamination in drinking-water wells overlying the Marcellus and Barnett Shales.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1322107111","nlmid":"7505876","tq":["Headlines on latest #fracking study are way oversimplified.

We present a patient with transient epileptic amnesia and a left temporal seizure focus, who developed isolated compulsive versifying, producing multiple rhyming poems, following seizure cessation induced by lamotrigine. Functional neuroimaging studies in the healthy brain implicate left frontotemporal areas in generating novel verbal output and rhyme, while dysregulation of neocortical and limbic regions occurs in temporal lobe epilepsy. This case complements previous observations of emergence of altered behavior with reduced seizure frequency in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Such cases suggest that reduced seizure frequency has the potential not only to stabilize or improve memory function, but also to trigger complex, specific behavioral alterations.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2630461,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":3,"cited_by_posts_count":260,"cited_by_tweeters_count":247,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":255,"context":{"all":{"count":2462009,"mean":4.9262390967069,"rank":3321,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458767},"journal":{"count":136,"mean":10.886740740741,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":135},"similar_age_3m":{"count":53283,"mean":6.803002627529,"rank":175,"pct":99,"higher_than":53108},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"pct":50,"higher_than":1}},"score":234.78,"history":{"at":234.78,"1d":7,"2d":11,"3d":11,"4d":11,"5d":13.75,"6d":14.6,"1w":14.6,"1m":234.78,"3m":234.78,"6m":234.78,"1y":234.78},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13554794.2014.953178","added_on":1409133066,"published_on":1409007600,"subjects":["psychology","neurology","psychiatry","behavioralsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411436172,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=235&types=msbttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=235&types=msbttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=235&types=msbttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2630461"},{"title":"The drivers of tropical speciation.","doi":"10.1038/nature13687","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Our new paper on the drivers of tropical speciation is out in Nature. @benbCNN @LSUscidean @LSU_MNS","Why are birds so diverse?

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

We describe a region in the human brain where electrical stimulation reproducibly disrupted consciousness. A 54-year-old woman with intractable epilepsy underwent depth electrode implantation and electrical stimulation mapping. The electrode whose stimulation disrupted consciousness was between the left claustrum and anterior-dorsal insula. Stimulation of electrodes within 5mm did not affect consciousness. We studied the interdependencies among depth recording signals as a function of time by nonlinear regression analysis (h(2) coefficient) during stimulations that altered consciousness and stimulations of the same electrode at lower current intensities that were asymptomatic. Stimulation of the claustral electrode reproducibly resulted in a complete arrest of volitional behavior, unresponsiveness, and amnesia without negative motor symptoms or mere aphasia. The disruption of consciousness did not outlast the stimulation and occurred without any epileptiform discharges. We found a significant increase in correlation for interactions affecting medial parietal and posterior frontal channels during stimulations that disrupted consciousness compared with those that did not. Our findings suggest that the left claustrum/anterior insula is an important part of a network that subserves consciousness and that disruption of consciousness is related to increased EEG signal synchrony within frontal-parietal networks.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2476057,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":5,"cited_by_feeds_count":7,"cited_by_gplus_count":15,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":138,"cited_by_rdts_count":4,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":90,"cited_by_accounts_count":135,"context":{"all":{"count":2413663,"mean":4.9000489480318,"rank":3365,"pct":99,"higher_than":2410297},"journal":{"count":377,"mean":3.6141968085106,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":376},"similar_age_3m":{"count":71247,"mean":6.715287595093,"rank":201,"pct":99,"higher_than":71046},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":11,"mean":2.105,"rank":1,"pct":90,"higher_than":10}},"score":228.6,"history":{"at":228.6,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":228.6,"6m":228.6,"1y":228.6},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2014.05.027","added_on":1404141964,"published_on":1403910000,"subjects":["neurology","behavioralsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Neuroscience","Medicine","Health Sciences","Life Sciences"],"last_updated":1407337390,"readers_count":65,"readers":{"mendeley":62,"connotea":0,"citeulike":3},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=229&types=1mbttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=229&types=1mbttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=229&types=1mbttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2476057"},{"title":"Prevention of muscular dystrophy in mice by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated editing of germline DNA.","doi":"10.1126/science.1254445","pmid":"25123483","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["Genome editing w/ CRISPR to prevent muscular dystrophy mouse model","#CRISPR genome editing corrects muscular dystrophy in mice","Genome editing with CRISPR/Cas9 to correct mutations associated with Muscle disease","Gene editing method shows promise for correcting Duchenne muscular dystrophy: More on #DMD"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4df3cf058f610001f6b","issns":["1095-9203"],"journal":"Science","cohorts":{"sci":59,"pub":109,"com":5,"doc":6},"abstract":"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an inherited X-linked disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, a protein required for muscle fiber integrity. DMD is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and a shortened life span, and there is no effective treatment. We used CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing to correct the dystrophin gene (Dmd) mutation in the germline of mdx mice, a model for DMD, and then monitored muscle structure and function. Genome editing produced genetically mosaic animals containing 2 to 100% correction of the Dmd gene. The degree of muscle phenotypic rescue in mosaic mice exceeded the efficiency of gene correction, likely reflecting an advantage of the corrected cells and their contribution to regenerating muscle. With the anticipated technological advances that will facilitate genome editing of postnatal somatic cells, this strategy may one day allow correction of disease-causing mutations in the muscle tissue of patients with DMD.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2594711,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":11,"cited_by_posts_count":219,"cited_by_tweeters_count":179,"cited_by_weibo_count":5,"cited_by_accounts_count":200,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3490,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458598},"journal":{"count":19937,"mean":22.54421488764,"rank":263,"pct":98,"higher_than":19674},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7818016087603,"rank":192,"pct":99,"higher_than":58985},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":503,"mean":71.184442231076,"rank":31,"pct":93,"higher_than":472}},"score":228.588,"history":{"at":228.588,"1d":0,"2d":8.298,"3d":8.298,"4d":8.298,"5d":8.548,"6d":8.548,"1w":10.748,"1m":80.088,"3m":228.588,"6m":228.588,"1y":228.588},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1254445","added_on":1408364391,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411388220,"readers_count":39,"readers":{"mendeley":32,"connotea":0,"citeulike":7},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=229&types=msbttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=229&types=msbttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=229&types=msbttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2594711"},{"title":"The changing face of cognitive gender differences in Europe.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1319538111","nlmid":"7505876","tq":["The changing face of cognitive gender differences in Europe - better conditions affect women more than men","Go #StemWomen!

Niacin lowers the LDL cholesterol level and raises the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level, but its clinical efficacy and safety are uncertain. Methods After a prerandomization run-in phase to standardize the background statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy and to establish participants' ability to take extended-release niacin without clinically significant adverse effects, we randomly assigned 25,673 adults with vascular disease to receive 2 g of extended-release niacin and 40 mg of laropiprant or a matching placebo daily. The primary outcome was the first major vascular event (nonfatal myocardial infarction, death from coronary causes, stroke, or arterial revascularization). Results During a median follow-up period of 3.9 years, participants who were assigned to extended-release niacin-laropiprant had an LDL cholesterol level that was an average of 10 mg per deciliter (0.25 mmol per liter as measured in the central laboratory) lower and an HDL cholesterol level that was an average of 6 mg per deciliter (0.16 mmol per liter) higher than the levels in those assigned to placebo. Assignment to niacin-laropiprant, as compared with assignment to placebo, had no significant effect on the incidence of major vascular events (13.2% and 13.7% of participants with an event, respectively; rate ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.03; P=0.29). Niacin-laropiprant was associated with an increased incidence of disturbances in diabetes control that were considered to be serious (absolute excess as compared with placebo, 3.7 percentage points; P<0.001) and with an increased incidence of diabetes diagnoses (absolute excess, 1.3 percentage points; P<0.001), as well as increases in serious adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal system (absolute excess, 1.0 percentage point; P<0.001), musculoskeletal system (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P<0.001), skin (absolute excess, 0.3 percentage points; P=0.003), and unexpectedly, infection (absolute excess, 1.4 percentage points; P<0.001) and bleeding (absolute excess, 0.7 percentage points; P<0.001). Conclusions Among participants with atherosclerotic vascular disease, the addition of extended-release niacin-laropiprant to statin-based LDL cholesterol-lowering therapy did not significantly reduce the risk of major vascular events but did increase the risk of serious adverse events.

Concomitantly, adolescents are initiating cannabis use at younger ages, and more adolescents are using cannabis on a daily basis. The purpose of the present study was to test the association between persistent cannabis use and neuropsychological decline and determine whether decline is concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users. Participants were members of the Dunedin Study, a prospective study of a birth cohort of 1,037 individuals followed from birth (1972/1973) to age 38 y. Cannabis use was ascertained in interviews at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, and 38 y. Neuropsychological testing was conducted at age 13 y, before initiation of cannabis use, and again at age 38 y, after a pattern of persistent cannabis use had developed. Persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline broadly across domains of functioning, even after controlling for years of education. Informants also reported noticing more cognitive problems for persistent cannabis users. Impairment was concentrated among adolescent-onset cannabis users, with more persistent use associated with greater decline.

Its concentration-dependent activity and prolonged half-life allow for single-dose treatment. Methods We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial in which adults with acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections received either a single intravenous dose of 1200 mg of oritavancin or a regimen of intravenous vancomycin twice daily for 7 to 10 days. Three efficacy end points were tested for noninferiority. The primary composite end point was defined as cessation of spreading or reduction in lesion size, absence of fever, and no need for administration of a rescue antibiotic 48 to 72 hours after administration of oritavancin. Secondary end points were clinical cure 7 to 14 days after the end of treatment, as determined by a study investigator, and a reduction in lesion size of 20% or more 48 to 72 hours after administration of oritavancin. Results The modified intention-to-treat population comprised 475 patients who received oritavancin and 479 patients who received vancomycin. All three efficacy end points met the prespecified noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points for oritavancin versus vancomycin: primary end point, 82.3% versus 78.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, -1.6 to 8.4 percentage points); investigator-assessed clinical cure, 79.6% versus 80.0% (95% CI for the difference, -5.5 to 4.7 percentage points); and proportion of patients with a reduction in lesion area of 20% or more, 86.9% versus 82.9% (95% CI for the difference, -0.5 to 8.6 percentage points). Efficacy outcomes measured according to type of pathogen, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, were similar in the two treatment groups. The overall frequency of adverse events was also similar, although nausea was more common among those treated with oritavancin. Conclusions A single dose of oritavancin was noninferior to twice-daily vancomycin administered for 7 to 10 days for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive pathogens.

However, studies dating back to 1977 have shown an increase in contamination of the meat, blubber, liver and kidneys of pilot whales. Several birth cohorts have been established in the Faroes in order to discover the health effects related to mercury and organchlorine exposure. In short the results have so far shown that: mercury from pilot whale meat adversely affects the foetal development of the nervous system; the mercury effect is still detectable during adolescence; the mercury from the maternal diet affects the blood pressure of the children; the contaminants of the blubber adversely affect the immune system so that the children react more poorly to immunizations; contaminants in pilot whales appear to increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease in those who often eat pilot whale; the risk of hypertension and arteriosclerosis of the carotid arteries is increased in adults who have an increased exposure to mercury; septuagenarians with type 2 diabetes or impaired fasting glycaemia tended to have higher PCB concentrations and higher past intake of traditional foods, especially during childhood and adolescence. Also impaired insulin secretion appears to constitute an important part of the type 2 diabetes pathogenesis associated with exposure to persistent lipophilic food contaminants. From the latest research results, the authors consider that the conclusion from a human health perspective must be to recommend that pilot whale is no longer used for human consumption.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1695662,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":2170,"cited_by_tweeters_count":617,"cited_by_accounts_count":621,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":587,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462281},"journal":{"count":106,"mean":7.1150476190476,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":105},"similar_age_3m":{"count":83764,"mean":7.4366771247449,"rank":57,"pct":99,"higher_than":83707},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":20,"mean":1.7526315789474,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":19}},"score":561.25,"history":{"at":561.25,"1d":10.25,"2d":16.75,"3d":16.75,"4d":17.6,"5d":17.6,"6d":17.6,"1w":17.6,"1m":199.45,"3m":212.95,"6m":416.25,"1y":559.95},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/ijch.v71i0.18594","added_on":1376847828,"published_on":1376853120,"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411529412,"readers_count":6,"readers":{"mendeley":6,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=562&types=mttttfff","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=562&types=mttttfff","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=562&types=mttttfff"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1695662"},{"title":"Intratumoral injection of Clostridium novyi-NT spores induces antitumor responses.","doi":"10.1126/scitranslmed.3008982","pmid":"25122639","nlmid":"101505086","tq":["Intratumoral injection of attenuated Clostridium novyi reduces tumors in animals and one human #NBThighlight","Bacterial injections shown to shrink a tumour #SPHPM #publichealth @BasiaDiug","Rather remarkable use of Clostridium as anti-tumor agent in canines and one human patient ($)","Intratumoral injection of Clostridium novyi-NT spores induces antitumor responses in dogs: #Cynology #DogHealth"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6373cf058f6100088bd","issns":["1946-6242"],"journal":"Science Translational Medicine","cohorts":{"pub":39,"com":2,"sci":11,"doc":4},"abstract":"Species of Clostridium bacteria are notable for their ability to lyse tumor cells growing in hypoxic environments. We show that an attenuated strain of Clostridium novyi (C. novyi-NT) induces a microscopically precise, tumor-localized response in a rat orthotopic brain tumor model after intratumoral injection. It is well known, however, that experimental models often do not reliably predict the responses of human patients to therapeutic agents. We therefore used naturally occurring canine tumors as a translational bridge to human trials. Canine tumors are more like those of humans because they occur in animals with heterogeneous genetic backgrounds, are of host origin, and are due to spontaneous rather than engineered mutations. We found that intratumoral injection of C. novyi-NT spores was well tolerated in companion dogs bearing spontaneous solid tumors, with the most common toxicities being the expected symptoms associated with bacterial infections. Objective responses were observed in 6 of 16 dogs (37.5%), with three complete and three partial responses. On the basis of these encouraging results, we treated a human patient who had an advanced leiomyosarcoma with an intratumoral injection of C. novyi-NT spores.

The bubbles of bubble wrap are easily filled by injecting the samples into them using a syringe with a needle or a pipette tip, and then sealing the hole with nail hardener. The bubbles are transparent in the visible range of the spectrum, and can be used as \"cuvettes\" for absorbance and fluorescence measurements. The interiors of these bubbles are sterile and allow storage of samples without the need for expensive sterilization equipment. The bubbles are also permeable to gases, and can be used to culture and store microorganisms. By incorporating carbon electrodes, these bubbles can be used as electrochemical cells. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of the bubbles by culturing E-coli, growing C. elegans, measuring glucose and hemoglobin spectrophotometrically, and measuring ferrocyanide electrochemically, all within the bubbles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2486326,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Analytical Chemistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Chemical Engineering","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Other Chemical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":4,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":168,"cited_by_tweeters_count":144,"cited_by_accounts_count":166,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.92638199219,"rank":4011,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458075},"journal":{"count":3023,"mean":1.9555923229649,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":3022},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74614,"mean":6.8074525886909,"rank":256,"pct":99,"higher_than":74358},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":351,"mean":1.8410971428571,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":350}},"score":210.514,"history":{"at":210.514,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0.5,"6d":0.5,"1w":0.5,"1m":4.85,"3m":210.514,"6m":210.514,"1y":210.514},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ac501206m","added_on":1404509497,"published_on":1404255600,"subjects":["chemistrytechniquesanalytical"],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Physical Sciences"],"last_updated":1411163857,"readers_count":8,"readers":{"mendeley":8,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=211&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=211&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=211&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2486326"},{"title":"Fish and fatty acid consumption and the risk of hearing loss in women","doi":"10.3945/ajcn.114.091819","nlmid":"0376027","tq":["Need another reason 2 eat #seafood?

We investigated the microbial growth and odor development in cotton and synthetic clothing fabrics. T-shirts were collected from 26 healthy individuals after an intensive bicycle spinning session and incubated for 28h before analysis. A trained odor panel determined significant differences between polyester versus cotton fabrics for the hedonic value, the intensity and five qualitative odor characteristics. The polyester T-shirts smelled significantly less pleasant and more intense, as compared to the cotton T-shirts. A dissimilar bacterial growth was found in cotton versus synthetic clothing textiles. Micrococci were isolated in almost all synthetic shirts and were detected almost solely on synthetic shirts by means of DGGE fingerprinting. A selective enrichment of micrococci in an in vitro growth experiment confirmed the presence of these species on polyester. Staphylococci were abundant on both cotton and synthetic fabrics. Corynebacteria were not enriched on any textile type.

Most retractions are associated with research misconduct, entailing financial costs to funding sources and damage to the careers of those committing misconduct. We sought to calculate the magnitude of these effects. Data relating to retracted manuscripts and authors found by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) to have committed misconduct were reviewed from public databases. Attributable costs of retracted manuscripts, and publication output and funding of researchers found to have committed misconduct were determined. We found that papers retracted due to misconduct accounted for approximately $58 million in direct funding by the NIH between 1992 and 2012, less than 1% of the NIH budget over this period. Each of these articles accounted for a mean of $392,582 in direct costs (SD $423,256).

However, parent readiness to make changes around child eating and physical activity (PA) behaviors can differ across domains. Using a cross-sectional design, our aim was to examine which factors were associated with parents being in the Action/Maintenance stage of change in each domain. From November 2008 to August 2009, parents of overweight/obese children (n=202) attending a tertiary care obesity clinic in Providence, RI, answered questions assessing their stage of change, beliefs about child health and weight, and provider behaviors. Separate multivariate logistic regression models were created to determine which factors were associated with parent readiness to make changes for child dietary and PA behaviors. Almost 62% of parents were in the Action stage of change for child dietary behaviors, but only 41% were in the Action stage of change for PA behaviors. Parents who believed their own weight was a health problem were less likely to be ready to make changes to their child's dietary behaviors. Physician discussion of strategies was related to readiness to make changes for child dietary behaviors, but not PA behaviors. In the PA domain, parents of younger children were more likely to be ready to make changes. Training health care providers to address PA readiness and be aware of factors influencing dietary and PA readiness may result in more effective conversations with parents and improve behavior change efforts for pediatric weight loss.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2526932,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":23,"cited_by_posts_count":40,"cited_by_tweeters_count":12,"cited_by_accounts_count":36,"context":{"all":{"count":2396096,"mean":4.8911416801106,"rank":4419,"pct":99,"higher_than":2391698},"journal":{"count":243,"mean":14.343198347107,"rank":3,"pct":98,"higher_than":240},"similar_age_3m":{"count":62040,"mean":6.6700824964941,"rank":257,"pct":99,"higher_than":61783},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":9,"mean":13.5625,"rank":1,"pct":88,"higher_than":8}},"score":193.78,"history":{"at":193.78,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":193.78,"6m":193.78,"1y":193.78},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jand.2014.04.029","added_on":1405973952,"published_on":1403650800,"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1406930815,"readers_count":2,"readers":{"mendeley":2,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=194&types=mmmmmbtt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=194&types=mmmmmbtt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=194&types=mmmmmbtt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2526932"},{"title":"Haootia quadriformis n. gen., n. sp., interpreted as a muscular cnidarian impression from the Late Ediacaran period (approx. 560 Ma)","doi":"10.1098/rspb.2014.1202","nlmid":"101245157","tq":["New 560 million year old fossil shows the first evidence of muscles in animals (oa)","Les recomendamos estos sitios: Suelos de más de 3000 millones de años: Haootia","Oldest evidence for fossilized muscular tissue - 560 million year old cnidarian impression fossil","Check out this newly discovered muscular 'jellyfish' from the dawn of time"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a3","issns":["1471-2954","0962-8452"],"journal":"Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences","cohorts":{"sci":7,"pub":17,"com":2},"altmetric_id":2630203,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":6,"cited_by_msm_count":17,"cited_by_posts_count":53,"cited_by_tweeters_count":26,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":51,"context":{"all":{"count":2454187,"mean":4.9214342792294,"rank":4619,"pct":99,"higher_than":2449568},"journal":{"count":2805,"mean":15.773076319544,"rank":16,"pct":99,"higher_than":2789},"similar_age_3m":{"count":50930,"mean":6.7820261147872,"rank":223,"pct":99,"higher_than":50707},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":12,"mean":9.722,"rank":1,"pct":91,"higher_than":11}},"score":193.73,"history":{"at":193.73,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":193.73,"3m":193.73,"6m":193.73,"1y":193.73},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.1202","added_on":1409125781,"subjects":["biology"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Environmental Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"last_updated":1410626220,"readers_count":2,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=194&types=mmsbtttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=194&types=mmsbtttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=194&types=mmsbtttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2630203"},{"title":"Potassium Intake and Risk of Stroke in Women With Hypertension and Nonhypertension in the Women’s Health Initiative","doi":"10.1161/strokeaha.114.006046","nlmid":"0235266","tq":["Potassium linked to lower risk of stroke #stroke","Potassium-rich foods (fruit, dried fruit, veggies, beans, salmon, milk, yogurt) reduce stroke.

Recent studies reveal that parental history and experiences also exert effects through epigenomic information not contained in the DNA sequence, including variations in sperm and oocyte cytosine methylation and chromatin patterning, noncoding RNAs, and mitochondria. Transgenerational epigenetic effects interact with conditions at conception to program the developmental trajectory of the embryo and fetus, ultimately affecting the lifetime health of the child. These insights compel us to revise generally held notions to accommodate the prospect that biological parenting commences well before birth, even prior to conception.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2594033,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":4,"cited_by_posts_count":188,"cited_by_tweeters_count":178,"cited_by_accounts_count":188,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":4670,"pct":99,"higher_than":2457417},"journal":{"count":19937,"mean":22.54421488764,"rank":341,"pct":98,"higher_than":19596},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7819486616195,"rank":254,"pct":99,"higher_than":58923},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":503,"mean":71.238928286853,"rank":40,"pct":92,"higher_than":463}},"score":192.936,"history":{"at":192.936,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":15.906,"3m":192.936,"6m":192.936,"1y":192.936},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1254400","added_on":1408361197,"published_on":1408057200,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1410370524,"readers_count":24,"readers":{"mendeley":24,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=193&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=193&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=193&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2594033"},{"title":"Detection of Atrial Fibrillation Using Contactless Facial Video Monitoring","doi":"10.1016/j.hrthm.2014.08.035","nlmid":"101200317","tq":["Diagnosis of atrial fibrillation by facial monitoring by @UofR @XeroxCorp #CDoM","Soon to your bathroom mirror!

The preponderance of evidence for indirect effects of predators on terrestrial plant communities comes from ecosystems where predators have been removed. Far less is known about the consequences of their restoration. The effects of removal and restoration are unlikely to be symmetrical because removing predators can create feedbacks that reinforce the effects of predator loss. Observational studies have suggested that the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone National Park initiated dramatic restoration of riparian ecosystems by releasing willows from excessive browsing by elk. Here, we present results from a decade-long experiment in Yellowstone showing that moderating browsing alone was not sufficient to restore riparian zones along small streams. Instead, restoration of willow communities depended on removing browsing and restoring hydrological conditions that prevailed before the removal of wolves. The 70-year absence of predators from the ecosystem changed the disturbance regime in a way that was not reversed by predator reintroduction. We conclude that predator restoration may not quickly repair effects of predator removal in ecosystems.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1222492,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":191,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":218,"cited_by_tweeters_count":16,"cited_by_accounts_count":212,"context":{"all":{"count":2433362,"mean":4.9056535828447,"rank":3244,"pct":99,"higher_than":2430135},"journal":{"count":2787,"mean":15.744305096913,"rank":9,"pct":99,"higher_than":2778},"similar_age_3m":{"count":268391,"mean":5.7385748127727,"rank":459,"pct":99,"higher_than":267932},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":409,"mean":26.015475490196,"rank":4,"pct":99,"higher_than":405}},"score":235.164,"history":{"at":235.164,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":191,"6m":191.5,"1y":209.772},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2012.2977","added_on":1360158997,"published_on":1356998400,"subjects":["biology"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Immunology and Microbiology","Physical Sciences","Environmental Science","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"last_updated":1407892914,"readers_count":53,"readers":{"mendeley":53,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=236&types=mbtfgggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=236&types=mbtfgggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=236&types=mbtfgggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1222492"},{"title":"Spatial and Temporal Occurrence of Blue Whales off the U.S. West Coast, with Implications for Management","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0102959","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Hotspots of blue whale occurrence off US west coast #IMCC3","Spatial Temporal Occurrence of Blue Whales off the U.S. West Coast","Superb science on US West Coast blue whale movement sets the bar for ship strike mitigation #whaleon","This is where you can find blue whales on the U.S. west coast, based on 171 satellite-tags"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","issns":["1932-6203"],"journal":"PLoS ONE","cohorts":{"sci":8,"pub":41,"com":2,"doc":1},"altmetric_id":2533487,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":34,"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":113,"cited_by_tweeters_count":52,"cited_by_accounts_count":104,"context":{"all":{"count":2433379,"mean":4.9056713769931,"rank":4682,"pct":99,"higher_than":2428697},"journal":{"count":51921,"mean":8.1002647534668,"rank":254,"pct":99,"higher_than":51667},"similar_age_3m":{"count":69373,"mean":6.7533795191143,"rank":302,"pct":99,"higher_than":69071},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":1764,"mean":11.586030629609,"rank":14,"pct":99,"higher_than":1750}},"score":190.51,"history":{"at":190.51,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":31.45,"3m":190.51,"6m":190.51,"1y":190.51},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0102959","added_on":1406145119,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1409875200,"readers_count":2,"readers":{"mendeley":2,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=191&types=mbtttfgg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=191&types=mbtttfgg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=191&types=mbtttfgg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2533487"},{"title":"Hepatitis B vaccination of male neonates and autism diagnosis, NHIS 1997-2002.","doi":"10.1080/15287394.2010.519317","pmid":"21058170","nlmid":"100960995","tq":["Boys vaxed at birth had autism at 3X rate of unvaxed boys. #vaccinesNOVA #CDCwhistleblower","Hep B vax at birth triples risk of autism in boys: #vaccinesNOVA #CDCwhistleblower #hearthiswell","HepB within 24 hours of birth without consent. #hearthiswell #CDCwhistleblower Cleaning up the damage for 11+ years.","#hearthiswell #CDCwhistleblower my son is from the age group studied #autism #Thimerosal"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d73cf058f610001198","issns":["1528-7394"],"journal":"Journal of Toxicology and Environmental Health, Part A","cohorts":{"pub":229,"doc":15,"sci":7,"com":6},"abstract":"Universal hepatitis B vaccination was recommended for U.S. newborns in 1991; however, safety findings are mixed.

This cross-sectional study used weighted probability samples obtained from National Health Interview Survey 1997-2002 data sets. Vaccination status was determined from the vaccination record. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds for autism diagnosis associated with neonatal hepatitis B vaccination among boys age 3-17 years, born before 1999, adjusted for race, maternal education, and two-parent household. Boys vaccinated as neonates had threefold greater odds for autism diagnosis compared to boys never vaccinated or vaccinated after the first month of life. Non-Hispanic white boys were 64% less likely to have autism diagnosis relative to nonwhite boys. Findings suggest that U.S. male neonates vaccinated with the hepatitis B vaccine prior to 1999 (from vaccination record) had a threefold higher risk for parental report of autism diagnosis compared to boys not vaccinated as neonates during that same time period.

In STAP, strong external stimuli such as a transient low-pH stressor reprogrammed mammalian somatic cells, resulting in the generation of pluripotent cells. Through real-time imaging of STAP cells derived from purified lymphocytes, as well as gene rearrangement analysis, we found that committed somatic cells give rise to STAP cells by reprogramming rather than selection. STAP cells showed a substantial decrease in DNA methylation in the regulatory regions of pluripotency marker genes. Blastocyst injection showed that STAP cells efficiently contribute to chimaeric embryos and to offspring via germline transmission.

With increasing human incursions into endemic regions and the reported possibility of airborne transmission, EBOV is a high-priority public health threat for which no preventive or therapeutic options are currently available. Recent studies have demonstrated that cocktails of monoclonal antibodies are effective at preventing morbidity and mortality in nonhuman primates (NHPs) when administered as a post-exposure prophylactic within 1 or 2 days of challenge. To test whether one of these cocktails (MB-003) demonstrates efficacy as a therapeutic (after the onset of symptoms), we challenged NHPs with EBOV and initiated treatment upon confirmation of infection according to a diagnostic protocol for U.S. Food and Drug Administration Emergency Use Authorization and observation of a documented fever. Of the treated animals, 43% survived challenge, whereas both the controls and all historical controls with the same challenge stock succumbed to infection. These results represent successful therapy of EBOV infection in NHPs.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1702937,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":9,"cited_by_feeds_count":7,"cited_by_gplus_count":16,"cited_by_msm_count":22,"cited_by_posts_count":152,"cited_by_tweeters_count":91,"cited_by_accounts_count":145,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":2048,"pct":99,"higher_than":2460040},"journal":{"count":1338,"mean":27.423148840688,"rank":15,"pct":98,"higher_than":1323},"similar_age_3m":{"count":83441,"mean":7.5670021093002,"rank":186,"pct":99,"higher_than":83255},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":114,"mean":36.707256637168,"rank":3,"pct":97,"higher_than":111}},"score":303.676,"history":{"at":303.676,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0.25,"1m":22.75,"3m":186.07,"6m":192.396,"1y":192.896},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.3006608","added_on":1377114455,"published_on":1377039600,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1410979263,"readers_count":10,"readers":{"mendeley":10,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=304&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=304&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=304&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1702937"},{"title":"Video: Sunflowers move to internal rhythm","doi":"10.1038/nature.2014.15548","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Sunflowers don't just follow the light: they also move to the beat of an internal clock /","How sunflowers track the light (with video)","Young sunflowers know how to dance!

Despite the long history of this folklore, published accounts of magpies collecting shiny objects are rare and empirical evidence for the behaviour is lacking. The latter is surprising considering that an attraction to bright objects is well documented in some bird species. The present study aims to clarify whether magpies show greater attraction to shiny objects than non-shiny objects when presented at the same time. We did not find evidence of an unconditional attraction to shiny objects in either captive or free-living birds. Instead, all objects elicited responses indicating neophobia in free-living birds.

Exposure to chronic poverty from infancy to early childhood as well as multiple measures of household chaos were also included as predictors of children's ability to recognize and modulate negative emotions in order to disentangle the role of interparental conflict from the socioeconomic forces that sometimes accompany it. Analyses revealed that exposure to greater levels of interparental conflict, more chaos in the household, and a higher number of years in poverty can be empirically distinguished as key contributors to 58-month-olds' ability to recognize and modulate negative emotion. Implications for models of experiential canalization of emotional processes within the context of adversity are discussed.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2681145,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Psychology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Cognitive Science","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":24,"cited_by_posts_count":34,"cited_by_tweeters_count":4,"cited_by_accounts_count":32,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9265209036095,"rank":5134,"pct":99,"higher_than":2457429},"journal":{"count":242,"mean":4.2776348547718,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":241},"similar_age_3m":{"count":42112,"mean":6.6196745743392,"rank":194,"pct":99,"higher_than":41918},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":13,"mean":0.57083333333333,"rank":1,"pct":92,"higher_than":12}},"score":181.66,"history":{"at":181.66,"1d":15,"2d":30,"3d":38,"4d":38,"5d":45,"6d":101.83,"1w":181.41,"1m":181.66,"3m":181.66,"6m":181.66,"1y":181.66},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0954579414000935","added_on":1410618843,"published_on":1410476400,"subjects":["psychology","psychiatry"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology"],"last_updated":1411506065,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=182&types=mmmmmbtf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=182&types=mmmmmbtf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=182&types=mmmmmbtf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2681145"},{"title":"Effect of High-Intensity Training Versus Moderate Training on Peak Oxygen Uptake and Chronotropic Response in Heart Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Crossover Trial.","doi":"10.1111/ajt.12873","nlmid":"100968638","tq":["Effect of HIIT in heart transplant recipients from Copenhagen colleagues.","El entrenamiento de alta intensidad en trasplantados cardiacos podría mejorar VO2 pico y cronotropismo","Research shows that H.I.I.T is also very beneficial to heart transplant patients!","Effect of HIIT Vs.

Recent data mining studies have suggested a potential association between cat bites and human depression. To explore this possible association in more detail we first used administrative diagnosis codes to identify patients with either depression or bites, drawn from a population of 1.3 million patients. We then conducted a manual chart review in the electronic health record of all patients with a code for a bite to accurately determine which were from cats or dogs. Overall there were 750 patients with cat bites, 1,108 with dog bites, and approximately 117,000 patients with depression. Depression was found in 41.3% of patients with cat bites and 28.7% of those with dog bites. Furthermore, 85.5% of those with both cat bites and depression were women, compared to 64.5% of those with dog bites and depression. The probability of a woman being diagnosed with depression at some point in her life if she presented to our health system with a cat bite was 47.0%, compared to 24.2% of men presenting with a similar bite. The high proportion of depression in patients who had cat bites, especially among women, suggests that screening for depression could be appropriate in patients who present to a clinical provider with a cat bite. Additionally, while no causative link is known to explain this association, there is growing evidence to suggest that the relationship between cats and human mental illness, such as depression, warrants further investigation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1665157,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":15,"cited_by_feeds_count":12,"cited_by_gplus_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":18,"cited_by_posts_count":364,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":305,"cited_by_accounts_count":354,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9263135916825,"rank":960,"pct":99,"higher_than":2461128},"journal":{"count":52439,"mean":8.1200796369045,"rank":54,"pct":99,"higher_than":52385},"similar_age_3m":{"count":81291,"mean":7.4641963341125,"rank":87,"pct":99,"higher_than":81204},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":3597,"mean":11.155813681869,"rank":8,"pct":99,"higher_than":3589}},"score":448.118,"history":{"at":448.118,"1d":1.25,"2d":47.16,"3d":57.81,"4d":72.14,"5d":155.42,"6d":170.75,"1w":170.75,"1m":175.85,"3m":177.8,"6m":177.8,"1y":439.968},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0070585","added_on":1375427206,"published_on":1375311600,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411484071,"readers_count":22,"readers":{"mendeley":22,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=449&types=mbtttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=449&types=mbtttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=449&types=mbtttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1665157"},{"title":"A chromosome-based draft sequence of the hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome.","doi":"10.1126/science.1251788","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["[Special Issue Research Article] A chromosome-based draft sequence of the hexaploid bread","Wheat = 17Gb hexaploid genome ( Humans = 6Gb diploid genome.

Many parents administer antipyretics even when there is minimal or no fever, because they are concerned that the child must maintain a \"normal\" temperature. Fever, however, is not the primary illness but is a physiologic mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. There is no evidence that fever itself worsens the course of an illness or that it causes long-term neurologic complications. Thus, the primary goal of treating the febrile child should be to improve the child's overall comfort rather than focus on the normalization of body temperature. When counseling the parents or caregivers of a febrile child, the general well-being of the child, the importance of monitoring activity, observing for signs of serious illness, encouraging appropriate fluid intake, and the safe storage of antipyretics should be emphasized. Current evidence suggests that there is no substantial difference in the safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in the care of a generally healthy child with fever. There is evidence that combining these 2 products is more effective than the use of a single agent alone; however, there are concerns that combined treatment may be more complicated and contribute to the unsafe use of these drugs. Pediatricians should also promote patient safety by advocating for simplified formulations, dosing instructions, and dosing devices.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":213271,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":22,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":293,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":47,"cited_by_weibo_count":208,"cited_by_accounts_count":280,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3411,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458677},"journal":{"count":5265,"mean":15.112929711246,"rank":47,"pct":99,"higher_than":5218},"similar_age_3m":{"count":52594,"mean":4.4410199075922,"rank":43,"pct":99,"higher_than":52551},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":123,"mean":11.628819672131,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":122}},"score":231.526,"history":{"at":231.526,"1d":0,"2d":0.25,"3d":0.25,"4d":0.25,"5d":0.25,"6d":0.25,"1w":0.25,"1m":0.5,"3m":177.3,"6m":177.3,"1y":208.058},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1542/peds.2010-3852","added_on":1312968913,"published_on":1298851200,"subjects":["pediatrics"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411350418,"readers_count":94,"readers":{"mendeley":93,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=232&types=ssssbtrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=232&types=ssssbtrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=232&types=ssssbtrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=213271"},{"title":"Parent-of-origin-specific allelic associations among 106 genomic loci for age at menarche.","doi":"10.1038/nature13545","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["GWAS identifies 100 loci that influence age at menarche","106 loci associated with age at menarche; 3 show parent-of-origin specific association","Age of puberty in girls influenced by imprinted genes","Genetics of puberty. 106 loci for age at menarche.

ILW is a heterogeneous wasteform that contains substantial amounts of cellulosic material encased in concrete. Upon resaturation of the facility with groundwater, alkali conditions will dominate and will lead to the chemical degradation of cellulose, producing a substantial amount of organic co-contaminants, particularly isosaccharinic acid (ISA). ISA can form soluble complexes with radionuclides, thereby mobilising them and posing a potential threat to the surrounding environment or 'far field'. Alkaliphilic microorganisms sampled from a legacy lime working site, which is an analogue for an ILW-GDF, were able to degrade ISA and couple this degradation to the reduction of electron acceptors that will dominate as the GDF progresses from an aerobic 'open phase' through nitrate- and Fe(III)-reducing conditions post closure. Furthermore, pyrosequencing analyses showed that bacterial diversity declined as the reduction potential of the electron acceptor decreased and that more specialised organisms dominated under anaerobic conditions. These results imply that the microbial attenuation of ISA and comparable organic complexants, initially present or formed in situ, may play a role in reducing the mobility of radionuclides from an ILW-GDF, facilitating the reduction of undue pessimism in the long-term performance assessment of such facilities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2544050,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Technology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Environmental Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":20,"cited_by_posts_count":40,"cited_by_tweeters_count":12,"cited_by_accounts_count":38,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":5524,"pct":99,"higher_than":2456564},"journal":{"count":806,"mean":6.7171055900621,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":804},"similar_age_3m":{"count":71158,"mean":6.7493407816518,"rank":358,"pct":99,"higher_than":70800},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":68,"mean":6.3302985074627,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":67}},"score":174.114,"history":{"at":174.114,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":1,"4d":1,"5d":11,"6d":11,"1w":11,"1m":173.264,"3m":174.114,"6m":174.114,"1y":174.114},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ismej.2014.125","added_on":1406567636,"published_on":1406242800,"subjects":["microbiology","environmentalhealth"],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411280313,"readers_count":1,"readers":{"mendeley":1,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=175&types=mmmmbttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=175&types=mmmmbttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=175&types=mmmmbttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2544050"},{"title":"Polar Bears from Space: Assessing Satellite Imagery as a Tool to Track Arctic Wildlife","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0101513","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Polar bear seen from space.

Although hatha yoga has frequently been recommended for patients with bipolar disorder (BD) and there is preliminary evidence that it alleviates depression, there are no published data on the benefits-and potential risks-of yoga for patients with BD. Thus, the goal of this study was to assess the risks and benefits of yoga in individuals with BD. Methods. We recruited self-identified yoga practitioners with BD (N=109) to complete an Internet survey that included measures of demographic and clinical information and open-ended questions about yoga practice and the impact of yoga. Results. 86 respondents provided sufficient information for analysis, 70 of whom met positive screening criteria for a lifetime history of mania or hypomania. The most common styles of yoga preferred were hatha and vinyasa. When asked what impact yoga had on their life, participants responded most commonly with positive emotional effects, particularly reduced anxiety, positive cognitive effects (e.g., acceptance, focus, or \"a break from my thoughts\"), or positive physical effects (e.g., weight loss, increased energy). Some respondents considered yoga to be significantly life changing. The most common negative effect of yoga was physical injury or pain. Five respondents gave examples of specific instances or a yoga practice that they believed increased agitation or manic symptoms; five respondents gave examples of times that yoga increased depression or lethargy. Conclusions. Many individuals who self-identify as having BD believe that yoga has benefits for mental health. However, yoga is not without potential risks. It is possible that yoga could serve as a useful adjunctive treatment for BD.

Furthermore, there is also evidence of experience-dependent plasticity in both human [3-5] and nonhuman primates [6] that is induced by repetitive tactile stimulation. Given the evidence of plasticity subsequent to both neural damage and tactile experience, we hypothesized that somatosensory damage could lead to increased levels of experience-dependent tactile plasticity. To examine this hypothesis, the tactile localization judgments of two individuals with left hemisphere somatosensory damage subsequent to stroke were examined. Suprathreshold tactile stimuli were presented to the hand or forearm, and the effect of the location of previous stimulation on localization judgments for subsequent stimuli was examined. Results showed that, only on the contralesional limb, even a single tactile stimulation could induce a significant perceptual shift in localization judgments for subsequent stimuli, with shifts occurring in the direction of the preceding stimulation. These results provide novel evidence of a very rapid time course for substantive perceptual changes in tactile location perception in response to simple stimulation, revealing a highly plastic and dynamic tactile system even many years after neural damage.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2569407,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Psychology And Cognitive Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":1,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":16,"cited_by_posts_count":54,"cited_by_tweeters_count":33,"cited_by_accounts_count":53,"context":{"all":{"count":2449541,"mean":4.9166756631877,"rank":5509,"pct":99,"higher_than":2444032},"journal":{"count":3476,"mean":15.773677697842,"rank":60,"pct":98,"higher_than":3416},"similar_age_3m":{"count":67602,"mean":6.7349919675744,"rank":344,"pct":99,"higher_than":67258},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":48,"mean":6.6971489361702,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":47}},"score":173.408,"history":{"at":173.408,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":14.66,"3m":173.408,"6m":173.408,"1y":173.408},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2014.06.023","added_on":1407169207,"published_on":1396911600,"subjects":["biology"],"scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1410447725,"readers_count":10,"readers":{"mendeley":10,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=174&types=mmbttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=174&types=mmbttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=174&types=mmbttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2569407"},{"title":"Neural compensation in older people with brain amyloid-β deposition.","doi":"10.1038/nn.3806","nlmid":"9809671","tq":["BBC News - Brain may 'compensate' for Alzheimer's damage and the relevant nature paper","Proposed neural compensation (fMRI) in people with amyloid-β deposition (association only)","Did they show compensation in Alzheimers or is it pathological hyper-excitability?","Brain tries to compensate for #Alzheimer disease.

The donated blood contained IgG EBO antibodies but no EBO antigen. EBO antigens were detected in all the transfusion recipients just before transfusion. The 8 transfused patients had clinical symptoms similar to those of other EBO patients seen during the epidemic. All were seriously ill with severe asthenia, 4 presented with hemorrhagic manifestations, and 2 became comatose as their disease progressed. Only 1 transfused patient (12.5%) died; this number is significantly lower than the overall case fatality rate (80%) for the EBO epidemic in Kikwit and than the rates for other EBO epidemics. The reason for this low fatality rate remains to be explained. The transfused patients did receive better care than those in the initial phase of the epidemic. Plans should be made to prepare for a more thorough evaluation of passive immune therapy during a new EBO outbreak.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2544381,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":19,"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_msm_count":10,"cited_by_posts_count":116,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":64,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":101,"context":{"all":{"count":2462870,"mean":4.926285717188,"rank":5645,"pct":99,"higher_than":2457230},"journal":{"count":2016,"mean":4.5380297766749,"rank":4,"pct":99,"higher_than":2012},"similar_age_3m":{"count":71204,"mean":6.7506555903543,"rank":368,"pct":99,"higher_than":70836},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":33,"mean":3.2328125,"rank":1,"pct":96,"higher_than":32}},"score":172.036,"history":{"at":172.036,"1d":1.85,"2d":2.85,"3d":2.85,"4d":3.1,"5d":3.1,"6d":3.1,"1w":3.1,"1m":87.48,"3m":172.036,"6m":172.036,"1y":172.036},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/514298","added_on":1406570534,"published_on":917827200,"subjects":["communicablediseases"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411530034,"readers_count":30,"readers":{"mendeley":30,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=173&types=mvbtttrf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=173&types=mvbtttrf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=173&types=mvbtttrf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2544381"},{"title":"Can Plants Grow on Mars and the Moon: A Growth Experiment on Mars and Moon Soil Simulants","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0103138","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Ever wondered if plants can grow in Martian soil?

The biological clock refers to the progression of time from puberty to menopause, marking the period during which women can conceive children. Findings from two experiments suggest that priming the passage of time through the sound of a ticking clock influenced various aspects of women's (but not men's) reproductive timing. Moreover, consistent with recent research from the domain of life history theory, those effects depended on women's childhood socioeconomic status (SES). The subtle sound of a ticking clock led low (but not high) SES women to reduce the age at which they sought to get married and have their first child (Study 1), as well as the priority they placed on the social status and long-term earning potential of potential romantic partners (Study 2). Findings suggest that early developmental sensitization processes can interact with subtle environmental stimuli to affect reproductive timing during adulthood.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2595379,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Behavioural Sciences","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Biological Psychology","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Social Sciences, general","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Anthropology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":17,"cited_by_posts_count":67,"cited_by_tweeters_count":42,"cited_by_accounts_count":63,"context":{"all":{"count":2455229,"mean":4.9226437381804,"rank":5716,"pct":99,"higher_than":2449512},"journal":{"count":127,"mean":11.265,"rank":2,"pct":98,"higher_than":125},"similar_age_3m":{"count":57171,"mean":6.776547105125,"rank":300,"pct":99,"higher_than":56871},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":5,"mean":6.695,"rank":1,"pct":80,"higher_than":4}},"score":170.34,"history":{"at":170.34,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":13.8,"3m":170.34,"6m":170.34,"1y":170.34},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12110-014-9210-7","added_on":1408367148,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["socialsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Social Sciences","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1410714727,"readers_count":4,"readers":{"mendeley":4,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=171&types=mmbttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=171&types=mmbttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=171&types=mmbttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2595379"},{"title":"A network analysis of food flows within the USA.","doi":"10.1021/es500471d","pmid":"24773310","nlmid":"0213155","tq":["How food moves within the US.

We present a novel application of network analysis to domestic food flows within the USA, a country with global importance as a major agricultural producer and trade power. We find normal node degree distributions and Weibull node strength and betweenness centrality distributions. An unassortative network structure with high clustering coefficients exists. These network properties indicate that the USA food flow network is highly social and well-mixed. However, a power law relationship between node betweenness centrality and node degree indicates potential network vulnerability to the disturbance of key nodes. We perform an equality analysis which serves as a benchmark for global food trade, where the Gini coefficient = 0.579, Lorenz asymmetry coefficient = 0.966, and Hoover index = 0.442. These findings shed insight into trade network scaling and proxy free trade and equitable network architectures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2327095,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":267,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":260,"cited_by_accounts_count":266,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3873,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458215},"journal":{"count":2880,"mean":7.8241292115318,"rank":10,"pct":99,"higher_than":2870},"similar_age_3m":{"count":78927,"mean":6.7247223475153,"rank":241,"pct":99,"higher_than":78686},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":182,"mean":7.973138121547,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":181}},"score":215.114,"history":{"at":215.114,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":1.95,"3m":170.164,"6m":215.114,"1y":215.114},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es500471d","added_on":1399306228,"published_on":1398898800,"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"last_updated":1409707897,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=216&types=bttttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=216&types=bttttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=216&types=bttttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2327095"},{"title":"Plump grizzlies offer diabetes clue","doi":"10.1038/nature.2014.15665","nlmid":"0410462","tq":["Fat grizzly bears don't get diabetes.

We investigated the impact of statewide job loss on adolescent suicide-related behaviors. Methods. We used 1997 to 2009 data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the effects of statewide job loss on adolescents' suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide plans. Probit regression models controlled for demographic characteristics, state of residence, and year; samples were divided according to gender and race/ethnicity. Results. Statewide job losses during the year preceding the survey increased girls' probability of suicidal ideation and suicide plans and non-Hispanic Black adolescents' probability of suicidal ideation, suicide plans, and suicide attempts. Job losses among 1% of a state's working-age population increased the probability of girls and Blacks reporting suicide-related behaviors by 2 to 3 percentage points. Job losses did not affect the suicide-related behaviors of boys, non-Hispanic Whites, or Hispanics. The results were robust to the inclusion of other state economic characteristics. Conclusions. As are adults, adolescents are affected by economic downturns. Our findings show that statewide job loss increases adolescent girls' and non-Hispanic Blacks' suicide-related behaviors.

On the other hand, much has been written about the negative effects of institutionalizing journal rank as an impact measure. So far, contributions to the debate concerning the limitations of journal rank as a scientific impact assessment tool have either lacked data, or relied on only a few studies. In this review, we present the most recent and pertinent data on the consequences of our current scholarly communication system with respect to various measures of scientific quality (such as utility/citations, methodological soundness, expert ratings or retractions). These data corroborate previous hypotheses: using journal rank as an assessment tool is bad scientific practice. Moreover, the data lead us to argue that any journal rank (not only the currently-favored Impact Factor) would have this negative impact. Therefore, we suggest that abandoning journals altogether, in favor of a library-based scholarly communication system, will ultimately be necessary.

In guinea pig paired atria, Zo.Cr exhibited a cardiodepressant activity on the rate and force of spontaneous contractions. In rabbit thoracic aorta preparation, Zo.Cr relaxed the phenylephrine-induced vascular contraction at a dose 10 times higher than that required against K (80 mM)-induced contraction. Ca2+ channel-blocking (CCB) activity was confirmed when Zo.Cr shifted the Ca2+ dose-response curves to the right similar to the effect of verapamil. It also inhibited the phenylephrine (1 microM) control peaks in normal-Ca2+ and Ca2+-free solution, indicating that it acts at both the membrane-bound and the intracellular Ca2+ channels. When tested in endothelium-intact rat aorta, it again relaxed the K-induced contraction at a dose 14 times less than that required for relaxing the PE-induced contraction. The vasodilator effect of Zo.Cr was endothelium-independent because it was not blocked by L-NAME (0.1 mM) or atropine (1 microM) and also was reproduced in the endothelium-denuded preparations at the same dose range.

We report here the hypotensive, endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilator and cardio-suppressant and stimulant effects of its aqueous extract (Zo.Cr). Zo.Cr, which tested positive for saponins, flavonoids, amines, alkaloids and terpenoids, induced a dose-dependent (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) fall in the arterial blood pressure (BP) of anaesthetized rats which was partially blocked by atropine (1 mg/kg). In isolated endothelium-intact rat aorta, Zo.Cr (0.01-5.0 mg/ml) relaxed the phenylephrine (1 microM)-induced contractions, effect partially blocked by atropine (1 microM). Zo.Cr inhibited the K+ (80 mM)-induced contractions and also shifted the Ca++ dose-response curves to the right, similar to verapamil, indicating Ca++ antagonist activity. An atropine-resistant and l-NAME-sensitive vasodilator activity was also noted from ginger phenolic constituents 6-, 8- and 10-gingerol, while 6-shogaol showed a mild vasodilator effect. In guinea-pig atria, Zo.Cr (0.1-5.0 mg/ml) inhibited the force and rate of atrial contractions. Pretreatment with atropine blocked the inhibitory effect and a stimulatory effect was unmasked which was resistant to propranolol and verapamil but sensitive to ryanodine, blocker of Ca++ release from intracellular stores. Later at doses >or=1.0 mg/ml, the extract completely suppressed the atrial tissue, effect resistant to glibenclamide, pyrilamine, aminophylline and L-NAME.

Our objective in this study was to examine the antihypertensive effects of H. sabdariffa tisane (hibiscus tea) consumption in humans. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in 65 pre- and mildly hypertensive adults, age 30-70 y, not taking blood pressure (BP)-lowering medications, with either 3 240-mL servings/d of brewed hibiscus tea or placebo beverage for 6 wk. A standardized method was used to measure BP at baseline and weekly intervals. At 6 wk, hibiscus tea lowered systolic BP (SBP) compared with placebo (-7.2 +/- 11.4 vs. -1.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P = 0.030). Diastolic BP was also lower, although this change did not differ from placebo (-3.1 +/- 7.0 vs. -0.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg; P = 0.160). The change in mean arterial pressure was of borderline significance compared with placebo (-4.5 +/- 7.7 vs. -0.8 +/- 7.4 mm Hg; P = 0.054). Participants with higher SBP at baseline showed a greater response to hibiscus treatment (r = -0.421 for SBP change; P = 0.010).

These results suggest daily consumption of hibiscus tea, in an amount readily incorporated into the diet, lowers BP in pre- and mildly hypertensive adults and may prove an effective component of the dietary changes recommended for people with these conditions.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":201925,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Animal Production","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":242,"cited_by_msm_count":1,"cited_by_posts_count":278,"cited_by_tweeters_count":12,"cited_by_accounts_count":260,"context":{"all":{"count":2394557,"mean":4.889912434708,"rank":2255,"pct":99,"higher_than":2392302},"journal":{"count":1904,"mean":6.3655123489228,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":1902},"similar_age_3m":{"count":51831,"mean":4.4100295195832,"rank":26,"pct":99,"higher_than":51805},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":20,"mean":14.518526315789,"rank":1,"pct":95,"higher_than":19}},"score":280.95,"history":{"at":280.95,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":165,"6m":209,"1y":251.25},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/jn.109.115097","added_on":1312206288,"published_on":1264982400,"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Medicine"],"last_updated":1406841943,"readers_count":35,"readers":{"mendeley":35,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=281&types=mbtfgggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=281&types=mbtfgggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=281&types=mbtfgggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=201925"},{"title":"Sodium and Potassium Intake and Mortality Among US AdultsProspective Data From the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey","doi":"10.1001/archinternmed.2011.257","pmid":"21747015","nlmid":"0372440","tq":["Watching your #bloodpressure?

However, the mechanisms underlying the purported health-promoting effects of DHA remain largely unclear, in part because molecular signaling pathways and effectors of DHA are only beginning to be revealed. In vascular smooth muscle cells, large-conductance Ca(2+)- and voltage-activated K(+) (BK) channels provide a critical vasodilatory influence. We report here that DHA with an EC50 of ∼500 nM rapidly and reversibly activates BK channels composed of the pore-forming Slo1 subunit and the auxiliary subunit β1, increasing currents by up to ∼20-fold. The DHA action is observed in cell-free patches and does not require voltage-sensor activation or Ca(2+) binding but involves destabilization of the closed conformation of the ion conduction gate. DHA lowers blood pressure in anesthetized wild-type but not in Slo1 knockout mice. DHA ethyl ester, contained in dietary supplements, fails to activate BK channels and antagonizes the stimulatory effect of DHA. Slo1 BK channels are thus receptors for long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, and these fatty acids--unlike their ethyl ester derivatives--activate the channels and lower blood pressure. This finding has practical implications for the use of omega-3 fatty acids as nutraceuticals for the general public and also for the critically ill receiving omega-3-enriched formulas.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1280269,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":242,"cited_by_msm_count":3,"cited_by_posts_count":282,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":16,"cited_by_accounts_count":263,"context":{"all":{"count":2402477,"mean":4.8865254146156,"rank":2236,"pct":99,"higher_than":2400345},"journal":{"count":23035,"mean":14.233675696796,"rank":109,"pct":99,"higher_than":22926},"similar_age_3m":{"count":81815,"mean":6.0692931283154,"rank":134,"pct":99,"higher_than":81681},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":970,"mean":19.274858617131,"rank":7,"pct":99,"higher_than":963}},"score":283.342,"history":{"at":283.342,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":165,"6m":197,"1y":239},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1221997110","added_on":1362496169,"published_on":1362355200,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1406841943,"readers_count":27,"readers":{"mendeley":26,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=284&types=1mbtgggg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=284&types=1mbtgggg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=284&types=1mbtgggg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1280269"},{"title":"Bean consumption is associated with greater nutrient intake, reduced systolic blood pressure, lower body weight, and a smaller waist circumference in adults: results from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.","pmid":"18845707","nlmid":"8215879","tq":["beneficios del consumo de granos (frijoles) para reducir la cintura, disminuir la presión arterial y otros beneficios"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007e94","issns":["1541-1087"],"journal":"Journal of the American College of Nutrition","cohorts":{"pub":2},"abstract":"Epidemiological studies have shown positive findings associated with legume consumption and measures of cardiovascular disease and obesity.

Here, we survey worldwide linguistic indicators and trends through the analysis of a large-scale dataset of microblogging posts. We show that available data allow for the study of language geography at scales ranging from country-level aggregation to specific city neighborhoods. The high resolution and coverage of the data allows us to investigate different indicators such as the linguistic homogeneity of different countries, the touristic seasonal patterns within countries and the geographical distribution of different languages in multilingual regions. This work highlights the potential of geolocalized studies of open data sources to improve current analysis and develop indicators for major social phenomena in specific communities.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1136962,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"cited_by_fbwalls_count":5,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":13,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":2432,"cited_by_tweeters_count":2252,"cited_by_accounts_count":2273,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.92638199219,"rank":53,"pct":99,"higher_than":2462035},"journal":{"count":52439,"mean":8.1200796369045,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":52437},"similar_age_3m":{"count":266385,"mean":5.62353545258,"rank":5,"pct":99,"higher_than":266380},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":6417,"mean":6.0261620947631,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":6416}},"score":1852.7979999999,"history":{"at":1852.7979999999,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":5.15,"3m":164.95,"6m":853.00000000001,"1y":1678.35},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0061981","added_on":1356064554,"published_on":1325376000,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1410398223,"readers_count":59,"readers":{"mendeley":58,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=1853&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=1853&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=1853&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1136962"},{"title":"An Observational Study of Erectile Dysfunction, Infertility, and Prostate Cancer in Regular Cyclists: Cycling for Health UK Study","doi":"10.1089/jomh.2014.0012","tq":["Does cycling cause male fertility-related issues?

T-705 suppressed replication of Zaire EBOV in cell culture by 4log units with an IC90 of 110μM. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR(-)(/)(-)) were used as in vivo model for Zaire EBOV-induced disease. Initiation of T-705 administration at day 6 post infection induced rapid virus clearance, reduced biochemical parameters of disease severity, and prevented a lethal outcome in 100% of the animals.

Components of energy balance (resting metabolic rate, physical activity thermogenesis, energy intake) and 24-h glycemic responses were measured under free-living conditions with random allocation to daily breakfast (≥700 kcal before 1100 h) or extended fasting (0 kcal until 1200 h) for 6 wk, with baseline and follow-up measures of health markers (eg, hematology/biopsies).RESULTS: Contrary to popular belief, there was no metabolic adaptation to breakfast (eg, resting metabolic rate stable within 11 kcal/d), with limited subsequent suppression of appetite (energy intake remained 539 kcal/d greater than after fasting; 95% CI: 157, 920 kcal/d). Rather, physical activity thermogenesis was markedly higher with breakfast than with fasting (442 kcal/d; 95% CI: 34, 851 kcal/d). Body mass and adiposity did not differ between treatments at baseline or follow-up and neither did adipose tissue glucose uptake or systemic indexes of cardiovascular health. Continuously measured glycemia was more variable during the afternoon and evening with fasting than with breakfast by the final week of the intervention (CV: 3.9%; 95% CI: 0.1%, 7.8%).Conclusions: Daily breakfast is causally linked to higher physical activity thermogenesis in lean adults, with greater overall dietary energy intake but no change in resting metabolism. Cardiovascular health indexes were unaffected by either of the treatments, but breakfast maintained more stable afternoon and evening glycemia than did fasting. This trial was registered at www.isrctn.org as ISRCTN31521726.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2408218,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":5,"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":21,"cited_by_posts_count":93,"cited_by_tweeters_count":58,"cited_by_weibo_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":86,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":3608,"pct":99,"higher_than":2458479},"journal":{"count":3451,"mean":12.189137391304,"rank":15,"pct":99,"higher_than":3436},"similar_age_3m":{"count":75757,"mean":6.752728945562,"rank":221,"pct":99,"higher_than":75536},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":45,"mean":9.2423636363636,"rank":1,"pct":97,"higher_than":44}},"score":224.542,"history":{"at":224.542,"1d":0,"2d":1,"3d":1,"4d":1,"5d":1,"6d":1,"1w":10,"1m":111.992,"3m":164.092,"6m":224.542,"1y":224.542},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.114.083402","added_on":1402004930,"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411408883,"readers_count":13,"readers":{"mendeley":11,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=225&types=msbttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=225&types=msbttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=225&types=msbttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2408218"},{"title":"The Vocal Repertoire of the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus): Structure and Function of Calls","doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0103460","nlmid":"101285081","tq":["Vocal variety in African penguins Listen to all six vocalizations here","Italian scientists translate calls of African penguins, decoding 4 adult vocalisations 2 juveniles begging calls","interesting penguin communication research","Vocal Repertoire of the African Penguin (Spheniscus demersus): Structure and Function of Calls"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","issns":["1932-6203"],"journal":"PLoS ONE","cohorts":{"pub":53,"sci":6,"com":3},"altmetric_id":2554464,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":13,"cited_by_posts_count":87,"cited_by_tweeters_count":62,"cited_by_videos_count":1,"cited_by_accounts_count":80,"context":{"all":{"count":2415263,"mean":4.90073949079,"rank":5923,"pct":99,"higher_than":2409339},"journal":{"count":51629,"mean":8.0674377082203,"rank":343,"pct":99,"higher_than":51286},"similar_age_3m":{"count":60914,"mean":6.6818372432814,"rank":342,"pct":99,"higher_than":60572},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":1544,"mean":11.146509397278,"rank":15,"pct":99,"higher_than":1529}},"score":164.03,"history":{"at":164.03,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":164.03,"6m":164.03,"1y":164.03},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0103460","added_on":1406743967,"subjects":["science","medicine"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1407401670,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=165&types=mvbttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=165&types=mvbttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=165&types=mvbttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2554464"},{"title":"Fixing the Troubled Mental Health System","doi":"10.1001/jama.2014.10369","pmid":"25122559","tq":["Oops!

Industrial chemicals that injure the developing brain are among the known causes for this rise in prevalence. In 2006, we did a systematic review and identified five industrial chemicals as developmental neurotoxicants: lead, methylmercury, polychlorinated biphenyls, arsenic, and toluene. Since 2006, epidemiological studies have documented six additional developmental neurotoxicants-manganese, fluoride, chlorpyrifos, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, and the polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We postulate that even more neurotoxicants remain undiscovered. To control the pandemic of developmental neurotoxicity, we propose a global prevention strategy. Untested chemicals should not be presumed to be safe to brain development, and chemicals in existing use and all new chemicals must therefore be tested for developmental neurotoxicity.

To characterize hepatotoxicity and its outcomes from HDS versus medications, patients with hepatotoxicity attributed to medications or HDS were enrolled prospectively between 2004 and 2013. The study took place among eight U.S. referral centers that are part of the DILIN. Consecutive patients with liver injury referred to a DILIN center were eligible. The final sample comprised 130 (15.5%) of all subjects enrolled (839) who were judged to have experienced liver injury caused by HDS. Hepatotoxicity caused by HDS was evaluated by expert opinion. Demographic and clinical characteristics and outcome assessments, including death and liver transplantation (LT), were ascertained. Cases were stratified and compared according to the type of agent implicated in liver injury; 45 had injury caused by bodybuilding HDS, 85 by nonbodybuilding HDS, and 709 by medications. Liver injury caused by HDS increased from 7% to 20% (P < 0.001) during the study period. Bodybuilding HDS caused prolonged jaundice (median, 91 days) in young men, but did not result in any fatalities or LT. The remaining HDS cases presented as hepatocellular injury, predominantly in middle-aged women, and, more frequently, led to death or transplantation, compared to injury from medications (13% vs. 3%; P < 0.05). Conclusions: The proportion of liver injury cases attributed to HDS in DILIN has increased significantly. Liver injury from nonbodybuilding HDS is more severe than from bodybuilding HDS or medications, as evidenced by differences in unfavorable outcomes (death and transplantation).

Such periods induce skeletal muscle loss and consequent declines in metabolic health and functional capacity, particularly during the early stages (1-2 weeks) of muscle disuse. The extent of muscle loss during injury strongly influences the level and duration of rehabilitation required. Currently, however, efforts to intervene and attenuate muscle loss during the initial two weeks of injury are minimal. Mechanistically, muscle disuse atrophy is primarily attributed to a decline in basal muscle protein synthesis rate and the development of anabolic resistance to food intake. Dietary protein consumption is of critical importance for stimulating muscle protein synthesis rates throughout the day. Given that the injured athlete greatly reduces physical activity levels, maintaining muscle mass whilst simultaneously avoiding gains in fat mass can become challenging. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that maintaining or increasing daily protein intake by focusing upon the amount, type and timing of dietary protein ingestion throughout the day can restrict the loss of muscle mass and strength during recovery from injury. Moreover, neuromuscular electrical stimulation may be applied to evoke involuntary muscle contractions and support muscle mass maintenance in the injured athlete. Although more applied work is required to translate laboratory findings directly to the injured athlete, current recommendations for practitioners aiming to limit the loss of muscle mass and/or strength following injury in their athletes are outlined herein.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2516136,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Human Movement And Sports Science","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Mechanical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":5,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":254,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":214,"cited_by_accounts_count":222,"context":{"all":{"count":2463312,"mean":4.9261719336312,"rank":6230,"pct":99,"higher_than":2457161},"journal":{"count":308,"mean":11.303198697068,"rank":4,"pct":98,"higher_than":304},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70409,"mean":6.9963295364163,"rank":406,"pct":99,"higher_than":70003},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":10,"mean":20.566666666667,"rank":1,"pct":90,"higher_than":9}},"score":162.3,"history":{"at":162.3,"1d":7.6,"2d":7.6,"3d":7.6,"4d":7.6,"5d":7.6,"6d":7.6,"1w":7.6,"1m":8.85,"3m":162.3,"6m":162.3,"1y":162.3},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17461391.2014.936326","added_on":1405583750,"published_on":1405465200,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Health Professions"],"last_updated":1411549956,"readers_count":7,"readers":{"mendeley":7,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=163&types=tttttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=163&types=tttttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=163&types=tttttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2516136"},{"title":"Long-sought neutrinos answer burning question about the Sun","doi":"10.1038/nature.2014.15779","tq":["After decades of searching, physicists final confirm the existence of low-energy neutrinos","In the time it takes to read this tweet, 100,000 billion neutrinos from the Sun will have passed through your brain!","Long-sought #neutrinos answer burning question about the #Sun - #Borexino #LNGS #Physics #science","First direct detection of solar low-energy neutrinos from pp-reaction by #Borexino detector: article on @NatureNews"],"altmetric_jid":"","issns":[],"journal":"Nature News","cohorts":{"pub":94,"sci":24,"doc":2,"com":5},"altmetric_id":2631839,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":152,"cited_by_gplus_count":2,"cited_by_msm_count":4,"cited_by_posts_count":290,"cited_by_rdts_count":2,"cited_by_tweeters_count":125,"cited_by_accounts_count":285,"score":162.25,"history":{"at":162.25,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":162.25,"3m":162.25,"6m":162.25,"1y":162.25},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2014.15779","added_on":1409160138,"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1410747402,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=163&types=mttrfffg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=163&types=mttrfffg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=163&types=mttrfffg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2631839"},{"title":"Early solar system.

earthquake following a protracted series of foreshocks. The Integrated Plate Boundary Observatory Chile monitored the entire sequence of events, providing unprecedented resolution of the build-up to the main event and its rupture evolution. Here we show that the Iquique earthquake broke a central fraction of the so-called northern Chile seismic gap, the last major segment of the South American plate boundary that had not ruptured in the past century. Since July 2013 three seismic clusters, each lasting a few weeks, hit this part of the plate boundary with earthquakes of increasing peak magnitudes. Starting with the second cluster, geodetic observations show surface displacements that can be associated with slip on the plate interface. These seismic clusters and their slip transients occupied a part of the plate interface that was transitional between a fully locked and a creeping portion. Leading up to this earthquake, the b value of the foreshocks gradually decreased during the years before the earthquake, reversing its trend a few days before the Iquique earthquake. The mainshock finally nucleated at the northern end of the foreshock area, which skirted a locked patch, and ruptured mainly downdip towards higher locking. Peak slip was attained immediately downdip of the foreshock region and at the margin of the locked patch. We conclude that gradual weakening of the central part of the seismic gap accentuated by the foreshock activity in a zone of intermediate seismic coupling was instrumental in causing final failure, distinguishing the Iquique earthquake from most great earthquakes. Finally, only one-third of the gap was broken and the remaining locked segments now pose a significant, increased seismic hazard with the potential to host an earthquake with a magnitude of >8.5.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2595392,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Seismology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tectonics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Geophysics","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":1,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":17,"cited_by_posts_count":55,"cited_by_tweeters_count":29,"cited_by_accounts_count":48,"context":{"all":{"count":2435172,"mean":4.9063644434024,"rank":6285,"pct":99,"higher_than":2428891},"journal":{"count":26494,"mean":41.273938625297,"rank":1601,"pct":93,"higher_than":24893},"similar_age_3m":{"count":50843,"mean":6.6207175956885,"rank":298,"pct":99,"higher_than":50545},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":544,"mean":68.215812154696,"rank":74,"pct":86,"higher_than":470}},"score":159.58,"history":{"at":159.58,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":66.13,"3m":159.58,"6m":159.58,"1y":159.58},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13681","added_on":1408367193,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1410026400,"readers_count":9,"readers":{"mendeley":9,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=160&types=mmbttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=160&types=mmbttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=160&types=mmbttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2595392"},{"title":"Delayed treatment of Ebola virus infection with plant-derived monoclonal antibodies provides protection in rhesus macaques.","doi":"10.1073/pnas.1213709109","pmid":"23071322","nlmid":"7505876","tq":["Prueban promisorio tratamiento para Ébola qu...

In pilot experiments testing a mixture of the three mAbs (MB-003), we found that MB-003 produced in both manufacturing systems protected rhesus macaques from lethal challenge when administered 1 h postinfection. In a pivotal follow-up experiment, we found significant protection (P < 0.05) when MB-003 treatment began 24 or 48 h postinfection (four of six survived vs. zero of two controls). In all experiments, surviving animals that received MB-003 experienced little to no viremia and had few, if any, of the clinical symptoms observed in the controls.

Little is known about how small turtles improve their survival probabilities with growth though it is assumed that they do. We reared green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and loggerheads (Caretta caretta) from hatchlings to 13 weeks of age and documented that they grew wider faster than they grew longer. This pattern of allometric growth might enable small turtles to more quickly achieve protection from gape-limited predators, such as the dolphinfish (Coryphaena hippurus). As a test of that hypothesis, we measured how dolphinfish gape increased with length, reviewed the literature to determine how dolphinfish populations were size/age structured in nearby waters, and then determined the probability that a small turtle would encounter a fish large enough to consume it if it grew by allometry vs. by isometry (in which case it retained its hatchling proportions). Allometric growth more quickly reduced the probability of a lethal encounter than did isometric growth. On that basis, we suggest that allometry during early ontogeny may have evolved because it provides a survival benefit for small turtles.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2220964,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Zoology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":222,"cited_by_tweeters_count":211,"cited_by_accounts_count":211,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":5723,"pct":99,"higher_than":2456364},"journal":{"count":76,"mean":5.3920266666667,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":75},"similar_age_3m":{"count":80544,"mean":6.9236377835442,"rank":378,"pct":99,"higher_than":80166},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":2,"mean":0.25,"rank":1,"pct":50,"higher_than":1}},"score":170.45,"history":{"at":170.45,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":42.45,"3m":159.05,"6m":169.45,"1y":170.45},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.zool.2013.11.004","added_on":1396114918,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1410134758,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=171&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=171&types=tttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=171&types=tttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2220964"},{"title":"Well-estimated global surface warming in climate projections selected for ENSO phase","doi":"10.1038/nclimate2310","nlmid":"na","tq":["So is Lewandowsky bringing dodgy statistical methods from psychology to cli-sci then?

Lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by Enterococcus (38%). Lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and Enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. A further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on Lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant genus in this type of product. Lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. The best strains according to the results obtained were Lactobacillus casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CTC1679, L. gasseri CTC1700, L. gasseri CTC1704, Lactobacillus fermentum CTC1693. Those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. L. casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678 and L. rhamnosus CTC1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) CFU/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":1899212,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Food Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Industrial Biotechnology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":14,"cited_by_feeds_count":7,"cited_by_msm_count":8,"cited_by_posts_count":92,"cited_by_tweeters_count":62,"cited_by_accounts_count":91,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":5736,"pct":99,"higher_than":2456352},"journal":{"count":263,"mean":1.8298473282443,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":262},"similar_age_3m":{"count":89655,"mean":7.7504304325519,"rank":505,"pct":99,"higher_than":89150},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":14,"mean":0.73076923076923,"rank":1,"pct":92,"higher_than":13}},"score":170.322,"history":{"at":170.322,"1d":1.25,"2d":34.08,"3d":35.83,"4d":41.93,"5d":156.592,"6d":156.592,"1w":156.592,"1m":157.592,"3m":157.592,"6m":157.592,"1y":170.322},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fm.2013.07.015","added_on":1384250724,"published_on":1375311600,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Immunology and Microbiology","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"last_updated":1411502650,"readers_count":25,"readers":{"mendeley":23,"connotea":0,"citeulike":2},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=171&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=171&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=171&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1899212"},{"title":"Analysis of a Food-Borne Fungal Pathogen Outbreak: Virulence and Genome of a Mucor circinelloides Isolate from Yogurt","doi":"10.1128/mbio.01390-14","nlmid":"101519231","tq":["Very elegant series of studies putting a fungus on my list of possible foodborne pathogens","Study reveals Fungus in Yogurt Outbreak Poses Threat (or why I wrestle out of date containers frm my family!) #fungi","Fungus in recalled yogurt more dangerous than originally reported: submitted by TA071014 [1 comment]","Fungus tied to yogurt in 2013 outbreak more dangerous than thought"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62c3cf058f6100080ff","issns":["2150-7511"],"journal":"mBio","cohorts":{"doc":5,"pub":13,"sci":11},"altmetric_id":2493235,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Microbiology","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_msm_count":19,"cited_by_posts_count":53,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":29,"cited_by_accounts_count":49,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":6528,"pct":99,"higher_than":2455559},"journal":{"count":667,"mean":17.366795795796,"rank":17,"pct":97,"higher_than":650},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74554,"mean":6.8325159282657,"rank":421,"pct":99,"higher_than":74133},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":4,"mean":4.0666666666667,"rank":1,"pct":75,"higher_than":3}},"score":157.5,"history":{"at":157.5,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":157.5,"6m":157.5,"1y":157.5},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01390-14","added_on":1404831160,"subjects":["microbiology"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1408562403,"readers_count":3,"readers":{"mendeley":3,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=158&types=mmmttttr","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=158&types=mmmttttr","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=158&types=mmmttttr"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2493235"},{"title":"Inhaled corticosteroids in children with persistent asthma: effects on growth.","doi":"10.1002/14651858.cd009471.pub2","nlmid":"na","tq":["Stunt your child's growth with inhalers.

In contrast to structural colour due to coherent scattering, white appearance generally requires a relatively thick system comprising randomly positioned high refractive-index scattering centres. Here, we show that the exceptionally bright white appearance of Cyphochilus and Lepidiota stigma beetles arises from a remarkably optimised anisotropy of intra-scale chitin networks, which act as a dense scattering media. Using time-resolved measurements, we show that light propagating in the scales of the beetles undergoes pronounced multiple scattering that is associated with the lowest transport mean free path reported to date for low-refractive-index systems. Our light transport investigation unveil high level of optimisation that achieves high-brightness white in a thin low-mass-per-unit-area anisotropic disordered nanostructure.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2593915,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Optical physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Optics and photonics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biological physics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Biophysics","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":3,"cited_by_feeds_count":4,"cited_by_msm_count":17,"cited_by_posts_count":34,"cited_by_tweeters_count":9,"cited_by_accounts_count":33,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":6549,"pct":99,"higher_than":2455539},"journal":{"count":5045,"mean":12.567248215702,"rank":54,"pct":98,"higher_than":4991},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7825527240773,"rank":351,"pct":99,"higher_than":58826},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":468,"mean":10.908274089936,"rank":9,"pct":98,"higher_than":459}},"score":157.19,"history":{"at":157.19,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":18.25,"3m":157.19,"6m":157.19,"1y":157.19},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep06075","added_on":1408360479,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1410160752,"readers_count":1,"readers":{"mendeley":1,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=158&types=mmmmbttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=158&types=mmmmbttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=158&types=mmmmbttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2593915"},{"title":"Quality control method for RNA‐seq using single nucleotide polymorphism allele frequency","doi":"10.1111/gtc.12178","nlmid":"9607379","tq":["@pknoepfler Dr. Endo at RIKEN published key paper on STAP reexamine.

Here, the implants are fused within the structure and function of the neuromuscular system as a result of metamorphic tissue remaking. The implants emerge with the insect where the development of tissue around the electronics during pupal development results in a bioelectrically and biomechanically enhanced tissue interface. This relatively more reliable and stable interface would be beneficial for many researchers exploring the neural basis of the insect locomotion with alleviated traumatic effects caused during adult stage insertions. In this article, we implant our electrodes into the indirect flight muscles of Manduca sexta. Located in the dorsal-thorax, these main flight powering dorsoventral and dorsolongitudinal muscles actuate the wings and supply the mechanical power for up and down strokes. Relative contraction of these two muscle groups has been under investigation to explore how the yaw maneuver is neurophysiologically coordinated. To characterize the flight dynamics, insects are often tethered with wires and their flight is recorded with digital cameras. We also developed a novel way to tether Manduca sexta on a magnetically levitating frame where the insect is connected to a commercially available wireless neural amplifier. This set up can be used to limit the degree of freedom to yawing \"only\" while transmitting the related electromyography signals from dorsoventral and dorsolongitudinal muscle

Chemicals from sunscreens (i.e., UV filters) accumulate in the sea and have toxic effects on marine organisms. In this report, we demonstrate that photoexcitation of inorganic UV filters (i.e., TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles) under solar radiation produces significant amounts of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a strong oxidizing agent that generates high levels of stress on marine phytoplankton. Our results indicate that the inorganic oxide nanoparticle content in 1 g of commercial sunscreen produces rates of H2O2 in seawater of up to 463 nM/h, directly affecting the growth of phytoplankton. Conservative estimates for a Mediterranean beach reveal that tourism activities during a summer day may release on the order of 4 kg of TiO2 nanoparticles to the water and produce an increment in the concentration of H2O2 of 270 nM/day. Our results, together with the data provided by tourism records in the Mediterranean, point to TiO2 nanoparticles as the major oxidizing agent entering coastal waters, with direct ecological consequences on the ecosystem.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2562953,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":64,"cited_by_tweeters_count":42,"cited_by_accounts_count":61,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":6784,"pct":99,"higher_than":2455304},"journal":{"count":2880,"mean":7.8241292115318,"rank":15,"pct":99,"higher_than":2865},"similar_age_3m":{"count":70702,"mean":6.7810675662296,"rank":437,"pct":99,"higher_than":70265},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":192,"mean":8.0116858638743,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":191}},"score":153.81,"history":{"at":153.81,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":45.88,"3m":153.81,"6m":153.81,"1y":153.81},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/es5020696","added_on":1406921871,"published_on":1406674800,"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"scopus_subjects":["Chemistry","Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"last_updated":1409666100,"readers_count":5,"readers":{"mendeley":5,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=154&types=mbtttttf","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=154&types=mbtttttf","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=154&types=mbtttttf"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2562953"},{"title":"Resetting Transcription Factor Control Circuitry toward Ground-State Pluripotency in Human","doi":"10.1016/j.cell.2014.08.029","nlmid":"0413066","tq":["Cool paper from Austin Smith's lab.

deficiency has been proven to affect fertility in mammals, but data in human is less convincing. In particular, data on in vitro fertilization (IVF), an attractive model to draw information on this topic, are sparse and conflicting. Objective: To investigate IVF outcome in women with deficient 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] serum levels (<20 ng/mL). Design: Prospective cross-sectional study. Setting: Infertility unit of an academic setting. Patients: The main inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) indication to IVF, (2) age 18-42 years, (3) BMI 18-25 kg/m(2), (4) adequate ovarian reserve according to Bologna criteria. Eligible women provided a serum sample for 25(OH)D measurement at the time of cycle preparation. Subjects were subsequently excluded if the cycle was cancelled or if the attempt was excessively delayed. Intervention: Quantitative detection of serum 25(OH)D. Main Outcome Measure: Clinical pregnancy rate. Results: The number of recruited women with serum 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL and ≥20 ng/mL was 154 and 181, respectively. The clinical pregnancy rates were 20% (30/154) and 31% (56/181), respectively (P = 0.02); the adjusted odds ratio for clinical pregnancy in women with vitamin D ≥20 ng/mL was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.23-3.77). Subgroup analyses showed that the group of women with the highest serum levels (>30 ng/mL) had the highest chances of pregnancy. Conclusions: Vitamin D is an emerging factor influencing female fertility and IVF outcome. Additional studies are pressingly needed to confirm a causal relationship and to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of vitamin D supplementation.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2595380,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Clinical Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_msm_count":18,"cited_by_posts_count":55,"cited_by_tweeters_count":34,"cited_by_weibo_count":3,"cited_by_accounts_count":55,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":6904,"pct":99,"higher_than":2455183},"journal":{"count":2972,"mean":4.871824974756,"rank":6,"pct":99,"higher_than":2966},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7826345139921,"rank":367,"pct":99,"higher_than":58810},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":77,"mean":5.2643421052632,"rank":1,"pct":98,"higher_than":76}},"score":152.35,"history":{"at":152.35,"1d":0,"2d":1,"3d":1,"4d":1,"5d":1,"6d":1,"1w":1,"1m":3.85,"3m":152.35,"6m":152.35,"1y":152.35},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1210/jc.2014-1802","added_on":1408367149,"published_on":1408143600,"subjects":["endocrinology","metabolism"],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology"],"last_updated":1411396207,"readers_count":3,"readers":{"mendeley":2,"connotea":0,"citeulike":1},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=153&types=mmsttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=153&types=mmsttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=153&types=mmsttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2595380"},{"title":"Imprint of primordial monster star found","doi":"10.1038/nature.2014.15751","tq":["Short-lived supermassive stars from the early universe leave a trace behind","Stellar archaeology finds evidence of monster stars thought to have populated the early Universe","Researchers find hints of the universe's enormous early stars","Astronomers find evidence of monster stars long thought to have populated the early cosmos"],"altmetric_jid":"","issns":[],"journal":"Nature News","cohorts":{"sci":25,"pub":146,"com":6,"doc":2},"altmetric_id":2616385,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":2,"cited_by_posts_count":194,"cited_by_rdts_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":179,"cited_by_accounts_count":185,"score":152.25,"history":{"at":152.25,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":14.45,"3m":152.25,"6m":152.25,"1y":152.25},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature.2014.15751","added_on":1408655401,"scopus_subjects":[],"last_updated":1410367617,"readers_count":0,"readers":{"mendeley":0,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=153&types=mttttrfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=153&types=mttttrfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=153&types=mttttrfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2616385"},{"title":"Marine teleost locates live prey through pH sensing.","doi":"10.1126/science.1252697","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["This catfish finds worms to eat by detecting smaller pH changes than you can","Wow!

We evaluated secukinumab, a fully human anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibody, in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Methods In two phase 3, double-blind, 52-week trials, ERASURE (Efficacy of Response and Safety of Two Fixed Secukinumab Regimens in Psoriasis) and FIXTURE (Full Year Investigative Examination of Secukinumab vs. Etanercept Using Two Dosing Regimens to Determine Efficacy in Psoriasis), we randomly assigned 738 patients (in the ERASURE study) and 1306 patients (in the FIXTURE study) to subcutaneous secukinumab at a dose of 300 mg or 150 mg (administered once weekly for 5 weeks, then every 4 weeks), placebo, or (in the FIXTURE study only) etanercept at a dose of 50 mg (administered twice weekly for 12 weeks, then once weekly). The objective of each study was to show the superiority of secukinumab over placebo at week 12 with respect to the proportion of patients who had a reduction of 75% or more from baseline in the psoriasis area-and-severity index score (PASI 75) and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point modified investigator's global assessment (coprimary end points). Results The proportion of patients who met the criterion for PASI 75 at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 81.6% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 71.6% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 4.5% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 77.1% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 67.0% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 44.0% with etanercept, and 4.9% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The proportion of patients with a response of 0 or 1 on the modified investigator's global assessment at week 12 was higher with each secukinumab dose than with placebo or etanercept: in the ERASURE study, the rates were 65.3% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.2% with 150 mg of secukinumab, and 2.4% with placebo; in the FIXTURE study, the rates were 62.5% with 300 mg of secukinumab, 51.1% with 150 mg of secukinumab, 27.2% with etanercept, and 2.8% with placebo (P<0.001 for each secukinumab dose vs. comparators). The rates of infection were higher with secukinumab than with placebo in both studies and were similar to those with etanercept. Conclusions Secukinumab was effective for psoriasis in two randomized trials, validating interleukin-17A as a therapeutic target.

interactions between thalamus and cortex, which are important for sensation, action, and cognition. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the first TRN ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting TRN neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensory-projecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-specific optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the TRN separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function.

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":950642,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":133,"cited_by_feeds_count":96,"cited_by_gplus_count":66,"cited_by_linkedin_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":25,"cited_by_posts_count":2040,"cited_by_rdts_count":12,"cited_by_rh_count":1,"cited_by_tweeters_count":1515,"cited_by_videos_count":2,"cited_by_accounts_count":1851,"context":{"all":{"count":2463987,"mean":4.9255608481562,"rank":41,"pct":99,"higher_than":2463971},"journal":{"count":23359,"mean":14.359939463995,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":23357},"similar_age_3m":{"count":71700,"mean":5.047754473563,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":71698},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":816,"mean":17.368596319018,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":815}},"score":2079.342,"history":{"at":2079.342,"1d":1.5,"2d":2.5,"3d":2.5,"4d":3,"5d":3,"6d":4.85,"1w":4.85,"1m":81.428,"3m":148.446,"6m":262.14,"1y":551.338},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1211286109","added_on":1347915782,"published_on":1347836400,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1411558885,"readers_count":819,"readers":{"mendeley":797,"connotea":0,"citeulike":22},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=2080&types=mvbtrflg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=2080&types=mvbtrflg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=2080&types=mvbtrflg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=950642"},{"title":"Wild

It has successfully explained past earthquakes (see, for example, ref. 2) and is useful for qualitatively describing where large earthquakes might occur. A large earthquake had been expected in the subduction zone adjacent to northern Chile, which had not ruptured in a megathrust earthquake since a M ∼8.8 event in 1877. On 1 April 2014 a M 8.2 earthquake occurred within this seismic gap. Here we present an assessment of the seismotectonics of the March-April 2014 Iquique sequence, including analyses of earthquake relocations, moment tensors, finite fault models, moment deficit calculations and cumulative Coulomb stress transfer. This ensemble of information allows us to place the sequence within the context of regional seismicity and to identify areas of remaining and/or elevated hazard. Our results constrain the size and spatial extent of rupture, and indicate that this was not the earthquake that had been anticipated. Significant sections of the northern Chile subduction zone have not ruptured in almost 150 years, so it is likely that future megathrust earthquakes will occur to the south and potentially to the north of the 2014 Iquique sequence.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2595190,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Seismology","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Geophysics","scheme":"npg"},{"name":"Tectonics","scheme":"npg"}],"cited_by_feeds_count":3,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":11,"cited_by_posts_count":77,"cited_by_tweeters_count":54,"cited_by_accounts_count":69,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":7295,"pct":99,"higher_than":2454792},"journal":{"count":26629,"mean":41.71801239297,"rank":1796,"pct":93,"higher_than":24833},"similar_age_3m":{"count":59177,"mean":6.7829055698256,"rank":388,"pct":99,"higher_than":58789},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":627,"mean":77.449638977636,"rank":94,"pct":85,"higher_than":533}},"score":147.76,"history":{"at":147.76,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":10.7,"3m":147.76,"6m":147.76,"1y":147.76},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13677","added_on":1408366143,"published_on":1407884400,"subjects":["science"],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"last_updated":1410276624,"readers_count":6,"readers":{"mendeley":6,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=148&types=mbtttttg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=148&types=mbtttttg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=148&types=mbtttttg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2595190"},{"title":"Detection of uranium and chemical state analysis of individual radioactive microparticles emitted from the Fukushima nuclear accident using multiple synchrotron radiation X-ray analyses.","doi":"10.1021/ac501998d","pmid":"25084242","nlmid":"0370536","tq":["...nuclear accident using multiple synchrotron radiation X-ray analyses","Detection of Uranium and Analysis of Individual Radioactive Microparticles from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident","Detection of Uranium and Chemical Analysis of Individual Radioactive Microparticles Emitted from the Fukushima","Detection of U chemical state analysis of radioactive microparticles emitted from Fukushima nuclear accident"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f61000224e","issns":[],"journal":"Analytical Chemistry","cohorts":{"pub":226,"sci":4,"doc":2},"abstract":"Synchrotron radiation (SR) X-ray microbeam analyses revealed the detailed chemical nature of radioactive aerosol microparticles emitted during the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant (FDNPP) accident, resulting in better understanding of what occurred in the plant during the early stages of the accident. Three spherical microparticles (~2 μm Φ) containing radioactive Cs were found in aerosol samples collected on March 14th and 15th, 2011, in Tsukuba, 172 km southwest of the FDNPP. SR-μ-X-ray fluorescence analysis detected the following 10 heavy elements in all three particles: Fe, Zn, Rb, Zr, Mo, Sn, Sb, Te, Cs, and Ba. In addition, U was found for the first time in two of the particles, further confirmed by U L-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra, implying that U fuel and its fission products were contained in these particles along with radioactive Cs. These results strongly suggest that the FDNPP was damaged to emit U fuel and fission products outside the containment vessel as aerosol particles. SR-μ-XANES spectra of Fe, Zn, Mo, and Sn K-edges for the individual particles revealed that they were present at high oxidation states, i.e., Fe3+, Zn2+, Mo6+, and Sn4+ in the glass matrix, confirmed by SR-μ-X-ray diffraction analysis.

of environmental concern, but little is known about their occurrence in surface water. An area of intense corn and soybean production in the Midwestern United States was chosen to study this issue because of the high agricultural use of neonicotinoids via both seed treatments and other forms of application. Water samples were collected from nine stream sites during the 2013 growing season. The results for the 79 water samples documented similar patterns among sites for both frequency of detection and concentration (maximum:median) with clothianidin (75%, 257 ng/L:8.2 ng/L) > thiamethoxam (47%, 185 ng/L:<2 ng/L) > imidacloprid (23%, 42.7 ng/L: <2 ng/L). Neonicotinoids were detected at all nine sites sampled even though the basin areas spanned four orders of magnitude. Temporal patterns in concentrations reveal pulses of neonicotinoids associated with rainfall events during crop planting, suggesting seed treatments as their likely source.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2535941,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":6,"cited_by_feeds_count":5,"cited_by_gplus_count":21,"cited_by_msm_count":7,"cited_by_posts_count":84,"cited_by_tweeters_count":38,"cited_by_accounts_count":77,"context":{"all":{"count":2426598,"mean":4.9002369590025,"rank":7191,"pct":99,"higher_than":2419407},"journal":{"count":376,"mean":6.8163093333333,"rank":4,"pct":98,"higher_than":372},"similar_age_3m":{"count":68399,"mean":6.7420239773092,"rank":453,"pct":99,"higher_than":67946},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":5,"mean":0.875,"rank":1,"pct":80,"higher_than":4}},"score":146.63,"history":{"at":146.63,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":0,"3m":146.63,"6m":146.63,"1y":146.63},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2014.06.033","added_on":1406215087,"subjects":[],"scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Environmental Science","Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"last_updated":1407766269,"readers_count":1,"readers":{"mendeley":1,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=147&types=mbtttfgg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=147&types=mbtttfgg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=147&types=mbtttfgg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2535941"},{"title":"A flexible skin piloerection monitoring sensor","doi":"10.1063/1.4881888","nlmid":"na","tq":["Another way to track emotions environment - sensor to monitor goosebumps on the human body in real time","Goosebumps sensor !

We also aim to examine a possible dose-response relationship in such an association. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal, prospective cohort study of all children born in Denmark between 1990 and 1999. Within this cohort, children with ADHD were identified. Data from national health registers on psychiatric and somatic diagnoses, stimulant prescriptions, cardiovascular risk factors, pre- and perinatal and sociodemographic covariates in all children and their parents were merged, using the unique personal identification number. Hazard ratios (HR) for cardiovascular events were estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for other known risk factors. Results: In the total population (n=714,258 contributing a total of 6,767,982 person-years) use of stimulants increased the risk of a cardiovascular event; adjusted HR=1.83 (1.10-3.04). In children with ADHD (n=8300) stimulant treatment also increased the risk of a cardiovascular event (adjusted HR=2.20 [2.15-2.24]), with a complex time-dependent dose-response relationship. Conclusions: This is the first nationwide cohort study of the cardiovascular safety of stimulants in children and adolescents, and it represents, to our knowledge, the longest prospective follow-up study. Cardiovascular events were rare but twice as likely in stimulant users as in non-users, both in the total national population and in children with ADHD. We found a complex, time- and dose-dependent interrelationship between cardiovascular adverse events and stimulant treatment in children and adolescents. Our results suggest a safety signal with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease associated with stimulant treatment in children and adolescents, even after adjusting for a number of potential confounders.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_id":2459941,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Pharmacology And Pharmaceutical Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_fbwalls_count":14,"cited_by_feeds_count":2,"cited_by_gplus_count":1,"cited_by_msm_count":14,"cited_by_posts_count":68,"cited_by_tweeters_count":35,"cited_by_accounts_count":66,"context":{"all":{"count":2462088,"mean":4.9262500512796,"rank":7375,"pct":99,"higher_than":2454713},"journal":{"count":203,"mean":4.4426732673267,"rank":1,"pct":99,"higher_than":202},"similar_age_3m":{"count":74477,"mean":6.8450941779902,"rank":459,"pct":99,"higher_than":74018},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":15,"mean":8.69,"rank":1,"pct":93,"higher_than":14}},"score":146.758,"history":{"at":146.758,"1d":0,"2d":0,"3d":0,"4d":0,"5d":0,"6d":0,"1w":0,"1m":3.8,"3m":145.658,"6m":146.758,"1y":146.758},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1089/cap.2014.0020","added_on":1403599484,"published_on":1403478000,"subjects":["psychopharmacology","pediatrics"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine"],"last_updated":1410732612,"readers_count":7,"readers":{"mendeley":7,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=147&types=mbttttfg","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=147&types=mbttttfg","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=147&types=mbttttfg"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2459941"},{"title":"Low-dose B vitamins supplementation ameliorates cardiovascular risk: a double-blind randomized controlled trial in healthy Chinese elderly","doi":"10.1007/s00394-014-0729-5","nlmid":"100888704","tq":["Low dose vitamin B supplement reduces cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score) in Chinese trial …","Low Dose B-Vitamins May Improve Cardiovascular Health More","Low-dose B vitamins supplementation ameliorates cardiovascular risk","B vitamins lower heart risk. #vitamins"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f610002844","issns":["1436-6215"],"journal":"European Journal of Nutrition","cohorts":{"pub":172,"doc":5,"sci":1,"com":2},"altmetric_id":2429236,"schema":"1.5.4","is_oa":false,"publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Chemistry","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition","scheme":"springer"},{"name":"Nutrition And Dietetics","scheme":"era"}],"cited_by_posts_count":180,"cited_by_tweeters_count":180,"cited_by_accounts_count":180,"context":{"all":{"count":2460081,"mean":4.9244769324595,"rank":7054,"pct":99,"higher_than":2453234},"journal":{"count":338,"mean":5.4262551928783,"rank":2,"pct":99,"higher_than":336},"similar_age_3m":{"count":75969,"mean":6.8234899957876,"rank":426,"pct":99,"higher_than":75543},"similar_age_journal_3m":{"count":12,"mean":3.4590909090909,"rank":1,"pct":91,"higher_than":11}},"score":150.6,"history":{"at":150.6,"1d":10.15,"2d":10.15,"3d":10.15,"4d":10.15,"5d":11,"6d":12.7,"1w":12.7,"1m":109,"3m":145.65,"6m":150.6,"1y":150.6},"url":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00394-014-0729-5","added_on":1402553699,"published_on":1402441200,"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing","Medicine"],"last_updated":1411475401,"readers_count":1,"readers":{"mendeley":1,"connotea":0,"citeulike":0},"images":{"small":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=64&score=151&types=tttttttt","medium":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=100&score=151&types=tttttttt","large":"https://altmetric-badges.a.ssl.fastly.net/?size=180&score=151&types=tttttttt"},"details_url":"http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=2429236"},{"title":"Evolution of responses to (un)fairness","doi":"10.1126/science.1251776","nlmid":"0404511","tq":["A paper on evolution of fairness in relationship to cooperation in apes","Sarah Brosnan and Frans de Waal: Evolution of responses to (un)fairness","Evolution of equality and reciprocity.

These cardiovascular afflictions increase risk for cognitive decline and dementia, but it is unknown whether these factors, specifically obesity and Type II diabetes, are associated with specific patterns of brain atrophy. We used tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to examine gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volume differences in 94 elderly subjects who remained cognitively normal for at least 5 years after their scan. Bivariate analyses with corrections for multiple comparisons strongly linked body mass index (BMI), fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels, and Type II Diabetes Mellitus (DM2) with atrophy in frontal, temporal, and subcortical brain regions. A multiple regression model, also correcting for multiple comparisons, revealed that BMI was still negatively correlated with brain atrophy (FDR <5%), while DM2 and FPI were no longer associated with any volume differences. In an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model controlling for age, gender, and race, obese subjects with a high BMI (BMI > 30) showed atrophy in the frontal lobes, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus compared with individuals with a normal BMI (18.5-25). Overweight subjects (BMI: 25-30) had atrophy in the basal ganglia and corona radiata of the WM. Overall brain volume did not differ between overweight and obese persons.

Steady improvements in computer hardware have been supported by periodic doubling of transistor densities in integrated circuits over the past fifty years. Such Moore scaling now requires ever-increasing efforts, stimulating research in alternative hardware and stirring controversy. To help evaluate emerging technologies and increase our understanding of integrated-circuit scaling, here I review fundamental limits to computation in the areas of manufacturing, energy, physical space, design and verification effort, and algorithms. To outline what is achievable in principle and in practice, I recapitulate how some limits were circumvented, and compare loose and tight limits.
